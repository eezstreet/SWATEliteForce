MissionDescription=("High Risk Warrant / Hostage Rescue","25 Glendive Lane","October 23 - 04:43")
BriefingText=("Get ready, men, this is a tough one.  Our target Lawrence Fairfax is the number one suspect in a string of grisly homicides.  A bit of review: over the last year and a half, seven women, all of them studying at the state university, disappeared.  Their remains, showing signs of torture and dismemberment, reappeared anywhere from a week to three weeks later.  The killer was careful; the task force forensic team was unable to get a useful DNA match from any of the bodies.","|That changed with the most recent find.  Another victim was located earlier this morning by a local laborer.  Some of the DNA scrapings from her nails match one of the men being investigated by the task force: Lawrence Fairfax.","|There's a complication: another student, Melinda Kline, went missing sometime around 2000 on October 18th.  That was six days ago.  If Fairfax has her, and if he's following the profile, chances are good she's still alive.  Rescuing her is your first priority, which is why we're going in with no warning.","|About our suspect.  Fairfax is employed as a temporary carpenter and works off and on at the University.  No police record, but court records show a pair of expired restraining orders against him.  He's been suspended from a recent jobsite for stealing supplies.  Fairfax's coworkers don't say much about him; he keeps to himself.  He's been at the law library multiple times, most notably on the days before the disappearance of three of our victims, including Melinda Kline.  A police interview with him was inconclusive; but the detective responsible did acquire a DNA sample from a used tissue. ","|Fairfax was seeing a psychiatrist when he was laid off; we've been unable to access his records.  The psych warned us that Fairfax may have fortified his living areas.  Be alert for traps, especially in spaces only Fairfax uses. He lives with his mother, Gladys Fairfax.   She's a recluse, and due to health problems rarely leaves the house.    We don't have reason to believe she's involved, but stay on your toes.","|Fellas, seconds may be the difference between life and death for Melinda Kline.  Study the layout, choose your gear, get moving.")
LocationInfoText=("25 Glendive Lane","|This house is a 2 bedroom, 1 bath, split level residence.  Many of the houses in this neighborhood are of this same type.

For the last two weeks, the Food Wall Restaurant has been under close surveillance.  We believe the owner, one Lian Niu, an experienced gunsmith, deals in the illegal modification of firearms, in this case, fabricating custom high-volume magazines.  Niu maintains a residence above the restaurant, and does his business there.  He's been questioned about illegal arms before, but walked.    ","|Ten minutes ago, Detective Sheary sighted Alex Jimenez entering the restaurant.  Look at your files; Alex Jimenez, also known as 'The Knife', is a hit man with Colombian connections.  He's a key suspect in multiple homicides over the last year and half.  Jimenez should be considered armed and dangerous.","|Sheary believes that Jimenez is presently inside the business, having modifications made to a MAC-10 submachine gun used in a recent homicide.  We want the evidence intact, so we can't give Jimenez and Niu any warning.  The restaurant's patrons and employees will still be in the building when you go in.  As always, target ID.","|Your first priority is, of course, to avoid any civilian injuries; but after that, secure the gun in Jimenez's possession.  OCID is looking forward to having a long talk with both Jimenez and Niu - and that gun is just the thing to make them chatty.  So take a careful look at the floorplans, plan your entry and gear up.")

It sells for up to eighty dollars a pop on the street.","|Knowing Jenkins, this is probably a bungled robbery for drug money, possibly related to a rash of recent convenience store hits.

The self declared militia group America Now has taken real estate heir James Betincourt Junior and Lawrence Adams, his general contractor, hostage.  Apparently they were touring a current project, the Old Granite Hotel, and were taken while inspecting Adams' work.  Now the suspects are holed up on the top two floors of the hotel, demanding twelve million dollars ransom by midnight.   They claim that Betincourt Investments owes this as a ''downpayment on their debt to the American People.''","|America Now is a small but active domestic militia group.  They are fiercely isolationist, opposing immigration, free trade, and foreign owned interests.   Most of their previous actions have been against foreign owned properties, either sabotaging them in the building stage or engaging in serious vandalism, making the properties too expensive to maintain.  This is their first kidnapping, and it may indicate a shift in the group's tactics.  Given the public nature of the incident, the group is clearly looking for publicity as well.  We've spoken with the media, and received some co-operation; however, it's not clear how long that will last.","|Expect the America Now suspects to be well equipped, and to act as a group, but their inexperience with hostages may make them even more dangerous to the civilians.  Take extra care.","|Now...on to the victims.  James Betincourt Junior is the son of the CEO and majority owner of Betincourt Investments, a French based property development company.  Six months ago, they purchased the Granite out of bankruptcy for twelve million dollars, and have been renovating it ever since.  Junior has been in charge of the renovations, and was doing an inspection of the renovation work when he was captured.  Lawrence Adams is the general contractor and the architect in charge of doing the renovation work. ","|The suspects are on the top two floors of the hotel, the sixth and the seventh.   You'll find the blueprints on the board.  We've cut power to the elevators, and one of them is trapped between the fifth and sixth floor.  You can either go up the stairs, or down the elevator shaft.  Recent gunshots were reported coming from the seventh floor, so it's time to go in.  ")

BriefingText=("If you haven't heard of the Army of Faith, here's your introduction.  A bit after 20 hundred hours a group of them broke into the Hologen research facility at Mount Threshold, closely affiliated with Mount Threshold University.   A couple of patrol cars responded quickly to the initial alarm, and the activists were trapped inside.   Unfortunately, trapped along with them are the building's late working scientists and graduate students.   The suspects have already released a statement declaring their willingness to become martyrs, and we have evidence of their willingness to make martyrs out of others.   It's a very touchy situation, with the potential to get worse.","|About the ''Army of Faith.''  They've been around for about two years, and have claimed credit for bombing research facilities doing work with stem cells and cloning technology.  Don't make the mistake of thinking of them as kooks.  Whatever they believe, they are also well armed, well trained, and dedicated to their cause. They've sent - and acted on - death threats to leading researchers in both fields, and this is not the first institution they've invaded.     ","|We think they intended the same sort of high damage, high speed raid at Hologen.  However, university police were nearby, and acted quickly to contain them.  Things are still confused enough that we don't know how many civilians are still in there, and we only have rough estimates on the number of suspects.  ","|Hologen is active in DNA cloning research, and we believe that is why they were targeted.  Our suspects are led by Jean Trouffant.   He is one of the major operatives in the Army of Faith.  Trouffant was wanted for bombing abortion clinics, before going underground and reappearing with the Army of Faith.   We don't have an accurate count of how many gunmen he has with him, but it's at least seven or eight, from eyewitness reports.","|One of the first things the Army of Faith did was take down the security system, so we don't know how many civilians are inside.  The suspects have named so far only Dr. Theodore Sturgeon as a hostage.   We believe he is in imminent danger from the suspects, as one of Hologen's key researchers.  As always, your first priority is to rescue him and get any other civilians out of there safely.  However, you should also keep your eyes open for Sturgeon's briefcase, which has contacts for other researchers around the world.  In the Army of Faith's hands, those documents become an open season list.   Study the location and your opponents, choose your gear carefully, and get in there.  There's a lot riding on this one. ")
