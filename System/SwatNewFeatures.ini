NewFeaturesLines=[B]5.7x28mm Submachine Gun[\\B] 
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=Designed by a leading European arms manufacturer, this ''personal defense weapon'' was originally intended for use by troops who did not use full-sized rifles and for whom pistols were ineffective against targets with modern body armor. Since its introduction, law enforcement and military personnel throughout Europe and the Middle East have adopted it. Its high reliability, large ammunition capacity and balance make it a desirable weapon.

NewFeaturesLines=[B]Colt Accurized Rifle[\\B] 
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=The Colt Accurized Rifle occupies the mid ground between an assault rifle and a dedicated sniper rifle. The CAR combines accurate range firing with the large ammo capacity required for urban field use and includes mounting points for a variety of scopes. Firing a 5.56mm round from a 20 round magazine, the CAR is only capable of firing in semiautomatic mode. Its length can make it a difficult weapon to wield in close quarters.

NewFeaturesLines=[B]5.56mm Light Machine Gun[\\B] 
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=This light support weapon is intended only for military operations; however, as with most weapons, some are available on the black market. The weapon is designed to be fired accurately from the hip or shoulder, though it is more commonly fired from a deployed bipod. It uses a box magazine holding 200 rounds of disintegrating-link ammunition.

NewFeaturesLines=[B]40x46mm Grenade Launcher[\\B] 
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=The grenade launcher has become a standard piece of police equipment for use in unusual situations such as hostage rescue or riot control. Its ability to fire a wide range of direct and indirect less-lethal ammunitions has proved it to be extremely versatile.

NewFeaturesLines=[B]9mm Machine Pistol[\\B]
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=This 9mm machine pistol is the scourge of law enforcement, considered only useful for drive-by shootings and armed hold-ups. Its high rate of fire and large ammunition capacity make it a favorite among criminals. Using anything other than full metal jacket rounds in this firearm greatly reduces its reliability.
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=[B]Mark 19 .50 Semiautomatic Pistol[\\B]
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=This semiautomatic pistol holds eight .50 Action Express rounds, providing the greatest stopping power of any handgun outside of a revolver. Favored by criminals for its considerable intimidation potential, it is often eschewed as a practical combat weapon due to its low ammunition capacity and excessive weight.
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=[B]Cobra Stun Gun[\\B]
NewFeaturesLines=
NewFeaturesLines=The Cobra is a dual-purpose less-lethal weapon. It fires small electrodes into the target and then sends a powerful electric charge down thin wires still connected to the hand unit. The electrical discharge causes involuntary contraction of the target's muscle tissue regardless of an individual's pain tolerance or mental focus. The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects. It has a longer range than its Taser forbearer and can fire darts in groups of four or two separate groups of two. It can also be used in ''touch-stun'' mode as a melee weapon. An onboard computer records information on shock intensity and duration, among other factors.
