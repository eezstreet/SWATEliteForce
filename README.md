# INTRODUCTION #

SWAT 4 is a fantastic, if horrendously bugged product. I've spent countless hours playing the game, mostly in CO-OP on servers new and old, and there always seemed to be a glimmer of potential that has never been truly realized by games that followed it.

The best way to explain SWAT: Elite Force in short is a complete overhaul of the original game. The broken AI is fixed, cut content has been restored, and every weapon is precisely calibrated to its real world counterpart. The main campaign, a combination of the vanilla game and The Stetchkov Syndicate, has a carefully crafted unlock system that you can play through with a friend to complete. If that isn't what you'd prefer, there's also an All Missions campaign which allows you to play through any mission, including custom ones on the hard drive, with any equipment in the game, including some which is multiplayer sepcific. Even after you've completed the campaign, there's various flavors of permadeath to tackle...if you think you're Elite enough...

The gameplay itself has been drastically changed. You can now aim down the sights, and there are now traps to disarm. Doors can have their lock checked with the melee key. Suspects can employ a wide variety of personality types, from your usual, sideways-shooting crook to insane domestic terrorists which murder civilians at whim to heavily armored thugs with light machine guns. Your team is much, much smarter too, and with the restored Speech Recognition feature, you can even order them around with an attached microphone. You'll need the extra speed too, because incapacitated civilians that spawn around the map will die if you aren't quick enough, which will impact your score. The command system has been vastly improved with a new LEADER THROW set of commands that let you be the one to throw the grenade, and SEARCH AND SECURE, which orders your officers to restrain all compliant hostages/suspects and secure all evidence in range. After restraining a suspect or hostage, your team will also report it to TOC.

The equipment system is incredibly robust. There's over 40 pieces of new equipment, some of which was cut from the original game. You'll need to manage your team's weight and bulk. Too much equipment, and an officer will become too overencumbered. By carrying less weight, you and your officers will move faster, and by carrying less bulk, you and your officers will interact with things faster. In singleplayer, you can also pick your team's helmet and body armor, which protect you similar to how they did in multiplayer. The breaching tab has been removed - instead, there are now six tactical slots and the breaching equipment is available as other equipment. There's twice as many ammo options as in the original game, and the choices matter, since new factors like drag (how much momentum the bullet loses over distance) and ricochet potential (how likely a bullet is to bounce off a surface) vary. Grenades and wedges come in 3-packs, at the cost of consuming more weight and bulk. Less lethal equipment is truly less lethal, since tasers may incapacitate or even kill the elderly, those in poor health, or drug users, and beanbags, stingers and flashbangs can be hazardous at close range.

The game is much more approachable as well, with a cleaned up user interface which functions well on modern widescreen resolutions. There's also an FOV slider and a mouse smoothing checkbox, preventing you from having to tinker with game files to accomplish the same thing. Perhaps most importantly, the game actually warns you when you've encountered a penalty. 

Initially, I envisioned SWAT: Elite Force as a tactical simulator that could be used to train police officers in a similar vein to Canadian Forces: Direct Action. After peeking at the games files however, I uncovered a wealth of unused content and decided to contact the original developers about the game. Over time, the game became a much larger, insane overhaul. It's been called the best way to play the game by most people, and I'm proud of that. Perhaps you'll find it to be the same.

# HOW TO INSTALL #

Copy the folder containing this folder (SEF) into your SWAT 4 directory (the one containing Content and ContentExpansion).
For the CD copy of the game, this folder is located in C:/Program Files (x86)/SWAT 4 or C:/Program Files (x86)/Sierra/SWAT 4
For the GOG version of the game, it's usually located in C:/GOG Games/SWAT 4

!!! CAUTION !!!
Do not extract the SEF folder *into* your Content or ContentExpansion folders (and therefore overwrite things), otherwise the mod will not work correctly.

To run the game, use the "Launch SEFMod.bat" file. To run SWATEd, use the "Launch SwatEd.bat" file.
You can make a shortcut to these .bat files for more convenience.

The mod can be removed by deleting the SEF folder from your hard drive.

NOTE: You may run into an issue with the game not saving your settings, or throwing an assertion failure at times in the Settings menu. This is mostly a problem with Windows Vista and up; try giving the folder write permissions or "Total Control". Alternatively you can make your SWAT4x.exe run in administrator mode.


# CHANGES, SUMMARIZED #

The Stetchkov Syndicate and base game missions are compressed into one campaign. As in The Stetchkov Syndicate, some equipment will need to be unlocked.

New campaign options! Now you will have a good reason to create more than one campaign...
 * A new EXTRA MISSIONS campaign. These are curated missions which have voice acting, full maps, and scripting, and they are designed to feel like part of the original game.
 * Now you can create an ALL MISSIONS campaign. This pulls all of the installed maps from your hard drive and makes them into a campaign, albeit without briefings. Great for use with an installed custom map pack, such as the Mega Map Pack!
 * ..and of course, the original SWAT 4 + TSS missions are a third campaign option.
 * PERMADEATH. There are two Permadeath options, for the extra challenge. AI Permadeath makes slain SWAT officers never come back, and Player Permadeath ends your campaign once you die.
 * CAMPAIGN CO-OP. This feature allows you to play any (non All Missions, non Permadeath) campaign in multiplayer. Help your friends complete their campaigns!

Suspects employ a greater variety of tactics. "Insane" suspects will shoot without hesitation at hostages. "Polite" ones on the other hand, won't make this a priority.
 * Suspects will also try to shoot at you as they're fleeing.
 * Suspects may now employ a "random patrol", "wander" strategy and don't stick to their assigned rooms as often.
 * Suspects have new equipment and may equip heavy armor.

Smarter Officer AI!
 * Upon restraining a target, SWAT officers will now report it to TOC automatically!
 * SWAT officers are much more efficient at clearing rooms and don't form "death funnels" at doors as often
 * SWAT officers can now take cover like suspects do (including leaning around corners)
 * SWAT officers won't shoot through civilians to hit their target and are better at aiming with less lethal items.
 * SWAT officers will drop a lightstick after clearing a room.

Traps. This is a huge cut feature from the game. Some doors may be trapped with bombs or alarms, and you'll need to adjust your approach to deal with it.
 * This is a small thing but it has huge ramifications. Since some doors will be trapped, you will need to take alternate routes instead of using the same strategy every time.

New secondary objectives.
 * Some maps have drug bags which may need to be collected to get a perfect score.
 * Incapacitated civilians may bleed out and die if they aren't reported to TOC in time, which impacts your score slightly.

More equipment options.
 * Over 40 new pieces of equipment have been added, including shotguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, tactical gear, and armor.
 * The player can carry armor and all helmet options in singleplayer.
 * The breaching tab is removed and replaced with a sixth tactical slot.
 * The player can select how many magazines they would like to bring in the mission.
 * Heavy armor now shows a health percentage on the HUD. Heavy armor at 100% health can stop almost any bullet in the game, but as it takes damage, it loses the ability to protect you. It can only be shattered by bullets and sabot slugs, not buckshot or other rounds.
 * 3-packs have been added for wedges and grenades.
 * All secondary weapons equippable as primaries, and some primaries now equippable as secondaries.

Equipment is also much more realistic.
 * Weapons can be aimed down the sights, for better accuracy, using the zoom key.
 * All of your equipment factors into two meters: WEIGHT and BULK. Weight dictates your speed and is a measure of how heavy your equipment is. Bulk affects interaction speed (C2 placing/wedging door/toolkit use, but NOT restraining) and measures how big your equipment is.
 * Bullets of certain types (FMJ, buckshot, etc) can now ricochet off of hard surfaces such as concrete, dirt, and water. Use caution.
 * Bullets are now subject to drag; they lose damage over distance.
 * Less lethal equipment is now actually LESS LETHAL. Some equipment (tasers, beanbag shotgun) can incapacitate or kill if used incorrectly.
 * All equipment has been modified to use real values.
 * Lightsticks can be thrown or dropped on the ground, just like grenades can. Everyone gets double the lightsticks!

Doors behave more realistically
 * Any shotgun can be used to breach any door.
 * A door may not be breached on the first shot of a shotgun. This depends on the material of the door. The M870 Breaching can breach any door in one shot.
 * When doors are breached with shotguns, they do not swing open like when breached with C2. You have to shoot the knob and then open the door.
 * Broken doors can now be closed and/or wedged.

Commands can be issued using your voice. To enable this feature, tick 'Use Speech Recognition' in the Audio Options.
 * See the SpeechCommands.md file for more information on how to issue orders using the Speech Command Interface.

Commands are easier to give with a new Graphic Command Interface with lots of submenus instead of a single long list.
 * You can now issue BREACH commands on unlocked doors.
 * You can now pick which style of BREACH you would like - either C2 & CLEAR or SHOTGUN & CLEAR
 * New CHECK FOR TRAPS command allows your AI companions to check doors for those all-important traps.
 * LEADER THROW commands: Now you can be the one to throw the grenade!
 * Lightsticks are broken into two commands: DROP LIGHTSTICK (where you order the nearest AI officer to drop a lightstick at their feet) and MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK (where you order an AI to drop a lightstick at what you're aiming at)
 * New RESTRAIN ALL, SECURE ALL, DISABLE ALL and SEARCH AND SECURE commands order officers to secure all targets near the player.

Harsher penalties for tougher gameplay.
 * Hostages and suspects that become incapacitated or killed now need to be reported to TOC, otherwise there is a penalty.
 * AI controlled officers can now trigger Unauthorized Use of Force when they use C2.
 * Snipers can now trigger Unauthorized Use of Force and Unauthorized Use of Deadly Force.
 ** The game seems to take some wild liberties as to what qualifies as a passing mission. You could shoot all of the suspects illegally (in some cases without getting any penalty) on Food Wall on Hard and still beat it. You would be FIRED if you did this in real life.
 ** A person being incapacitated is a big deal, and an ambulance would need to be ordered. Failing to disclose this could put their lives in jeopardy, so it makes sense for this to be a penalty. It did this for officers though (?) which I found odd.

Important QOL (quality-of-life) and playability features that are essential to playing the game.
 * There is an FOV slider and Mouse Smoothing disable checkbox. Also, widescreen resolutions are available in the menu and are (mostly) free of bugs.
 * Option to disable the initial dispatch briefings.
 * The game will tell you when you incur a penalty or complete an objective.
 * Wedges, grenades, lightsticks and C2 all show how many pieces you have left, while you have them equipped.
 * You can now assign loadout tabs (or whole loadouts) to one officer, a team, or the whole element.

Multiplayer improvements!
 * Snipers are now available in multiplayer.
 * New kinds of voting: Next Map and End Current Map
 * The chat now reports which room a person is when they send a chat message
 * You can enable or disable friendly fire in CO-OP.
 * You can now un-ready yourself in the pre-game lobby.

## HOW DO I INSTALL THE MOD?
Please read the How to Install section of this README. :)

## HOW DO I USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION?
First, you will need to ensure that your operating system supports Speech Recognition. What you'll need is the Microsoft Speech Recognition API, which is available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27224
If your system meets the requirements, the 'Use Speech Recognition' checkbox will be available.
You can also bind a key to toggle the functionality ingame, which is good when you're speaking for a Let's Play, for example.
A list of trigger words is provided, starting with Patch 5.1. See SpeechCommands.md for more information.

IF SPEECH RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK (CHECKBOX GREYED OUT):

- What language is your operating system? *By default, the game will only work with an English (United States) version of Windows.* 
In order to support more languages, you will need to edit your SEF/System/SpeechCommandGrammar.xml. Near the top of the file will be a line that reads like this:
```
<GRAMMAR LANGID="409">
```
You will want to modify this line so that it uses a number which corresponds to your operating system (NOT THE GAME!). 
The list of languages can be found here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/hh361638
So for instance, if you have a Swedish operating system, you will want to change it so the line looks like this:
```
<GRAMMAR LANGID="41D">
```

- Did you install the API? (see the above link)

- Still not working? Try installing the Speech Recognition Improvement mod, and see if that mod works.


IF SPEECH RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK (COMMAND NOT RECOGNIZED, OR MICROPHONE NOT WORKING)

- Check to make sure that you did not disable the speech recognition with the keybind. (The key is not bound to anything by default)

- Check to make sure that the microphone works in Windows. 

- Check to make sure that the microphone works in the game (try using the built-in VOIP feature and see if your friends can hear you in a multiplayer game)

- Make sure there is no background noise, like a television. The game may misinterpret it as being your voice.

- Make sure you are speaking clearly. 
If you are using the language fix from the above, you will want to speak with a bad accent as much as possible. Really roll those Rs if you're using a Spanish OS.
If you aren't, try to talk like you're a newscaster or like you're having a conversation with someone on the phone and they aren't understanding you.
Also note that some things sound similar. For example, "Cuff her" sounds a lot like "cover".

- Make sure you are saying the correct thing.
See the SpeechCommands.md if you are having trouble saying a particular command.

## WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK" AND "DROP LIGHTSTICK"?
MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK orders the nearest officer to go to the location and drop a lightstick. DROP LIGHTSTICK orders the nearest officer to drop a lightstick at their feet.

## HOW CAN I CHECK FOR TRAPS IN MULTIPLAYER?
Use the Optiwand, and aim up at the doorknob. The AI in singleplayer don't use the optiwand because they're super duper pros at it, and pulling out the optiwand is slower.

## HOW CAN I PLAY IN MULTIPLAYER? ARE THERE ANY SERVERS?
Please read the How to Play in Multiplayer section of this README. :)

## HOW CAN I REPORT A BUG?
The best, and preferred method is to post it directly on our GitHub issues page: https://github.com/eezstreet/SWATEliteForce/issues
However, since doing so requires a GitHub account, it's not the most desirable option. You can also post on the Moddb page, which doesn't require an account.
Additionally, you can check us out on Discord, and chat with the developers: https://discord.gg/RfujTnF

## WHY CAN'T I PLAY IN BARRICADED SUSPECTS, VIP ESCORT, SMASH AND GRAB, OR RAPID DEPLOYMENT?
This mod uses very realistic values for the weapons, and ultimately it doesn't play well in PvP modes for those reasons.
Personally I would recommend playing these PvP modes on the original SWAT 4, non-TSS, since the PvP balance is as good as it can get.

## ARE YOU GOING TO ADD AI OFFICERS IN CAREER CO-OP?
Possibly.

## DOES THIS MOD WORK WITH OTHER MODS?
Here's a good list of mods that will generally work out of the box, without any kind of issues:
- Any kind of custom map, including the Mega Map Pack
- Any kind of added custom skin
- Any kind of texture mod, like SWAT 4: GEM

Here's a good list of mods that will work, with tinkering:
- The Mega Map Campaign Mod. This will work if you don't include the changes to the System folder. The maps themselves will work in an All Missions campaign without further modding.
- SWAT 4: Remake. The weapons can be merged into SEF, but this requires some modding knowledge. They have a guide somewhere about merging the two mods.
- Any kind of custom weapon model mod, like Brettskie's M4 mod. Again, this will require some modding knowledge but it's possible to merge them.

Here's a good list of mods that won't work, even with tinkering:
- Any kind of code mod (11-99 enhancement mod, SSF, ...)
- SAS mod; the weapons from that mod are included with SEF though.
- Speech Recognition Improvement; the Speech Recognition feature is available but not all of the commands from that mod are present.

## I PLAYED IN SINGLEPLAYER, BUT THERE'S VERY FEW MISSIONS (1 OR 2). WHY?
You most likely selected the Extra Missions path when you started the career. There's three options: Extra Missions (missions added by the mod), SWAT 4 + TSS (the original game's missions), and All Missions (all missions from your hard drive, with no equipment progression). 

## ARE THERE MORE MISSIONS FOR EXTRA MISSIONS COMING OUT?
Yes.

## I CAN'T FIND X PIECE OF EQUIPMENT! DID YOU REMOVE IT?
Only the ammo pouch was removed from the base game. If you cannot find a piece of equipment, make sure you have unlocked it in the campaign!
Note that some equipment (M16, Uzi, AKM, etc) is only available in multiplayer.

## BREACHING DOORS WITH THE SHOTGUN DOESN'T WORK!
Whether or not a shotgun breaches the door successfully is random and depends upon a few things:

- The material of the door (wooden doors are easier to breach than metal ones)

- The ammo type you are using (larger pellets = more likely to breach)

- Which shotgun you are using (the M870 Breaching *always* breaches the door on the first shot)

Generally it takes about 2-3 shots on a wooden door and 3-4 shots on a metal door to breach it successfully.

## BEANBAGS DON'T WORK!
Beanbags can be negated by body armor. Try aiming for unarmored parts of the body.

## HOW DO I DISARM A TRAP?
You can't disarm a trap if it's on the other side of a door. You can either blow it up (if it's electronic) with C2 or you can go around. Or just take the penalty.


# KNOWN ISSUES #

Please read the FAQ before looking here! It's entirely possible that what you are seeing is intentional behavior.
  * TOC won't reply when an AI-controlled officer reports something. There's lots of code that needs to be altered to make this work.
  * Officers sometimes ignore orders, you might have to issue a command two or three times. Problem of the original game.
  * Officers sometimes ignore orders and say something like "I'm busy." This is a problem of the original game; they sometimes can see suspects where the player can't.
  * Occasionally in an All Missions campaign it will display the wrong equipment icons in the loadout menu for some pieces of equipment.
  * SWAT officers will stop following you or covering an area when they engage with a suspect. Problem of the original game.
  * "gui_tex package version mismatch" when joining a server --> Make sure you are running under International language. Sometimes it defaults itself to English or some other language. Search for `Language=eng` or `Language=grm` in SEF/System/Swat4x.ini and make sure it's set to `Language=int`


# OTHER MINOR CHANGES #

## TSS BUGS FIXED ##
 * Typos, wrong captions, etc fixed throughout.
 * AI-Controlled Officers will fire their weapons/non lethal equipment much more smartly and won't kill hostages or waste taser/pepper spray ammo needlessly.
 * AI-Controlled Officers wouldn't give a verbal response to the COVER command.
 * AI-Controlled Officers, when ordered to breach a room with a breaching shotgun, would shoot the lock, there would be a pause, and the lock would appear broken. The pause is removed.
 * It was possible to access equipment in singleplayer when it wasn't unlocked by creating a custom loadout; it will now tell you that the equipment is not unlocked when doing so.
 * "Press ESC and debrief to exit the game" now shows on ALL missions, not just Food Wall, Fairfax Residence and Qwik Fuel missions.
 * Punching a restrained suspect no longer makes them stand up.
 * Punching while changing weapons or while arresting will no longer turn your weapon invisible.
 * Wild-Gunner AIs had the wrong weapon equipped (M4A1 instead of M249 SAW)
 * Wild-Gunner AIs will no longer sweep back and forth while compliant.
 * M249 SAW, P90 and TEC-9 made the wrong sound effect when fired in Full-Auto from other player's perspectives
 * M249 SAW and P90 had ugly/weird first person positioning.
 * Colt Accurized Rifle and Grenade Launcher had no animations for the AI-controlled officers when they were holding them.
 * P90 was using wrong animations when held by AI-controlled officers
 * TEC-9 did not have any reload sound effects
 * TEC-9 did not use a flashlight despite the model having one
 * Night vision goggles no longer alert AI to your presence
 * Explosion effects from gas cans DO alert AI to your presence now
 * Office workers on Department of Agriculture and terrorists from Mt. Threshold Research Center had stupidly high max morale, this has been changed.
 * Suspects weren't taking into account whether a door was locked or wedged when fleeing, which would lead to cases where they would try to open the door in an endless loop while running away.
 * Arresting people with No Armor equipped was glitchy
 * The Multiplayer ESC menu didn't show colors on the server name
 * Taser recoil applied to every player on the map, not just the person who shot it
 * Lightstick-related commands weren't greyed out if there weren't any officers with lightsticks
 * Weapons couldn't be picked up while aiming through incapacitated/dead suspects/civilians
 * Lightsticks couldn't be dropped if the officer was wearing heavy armor (they would appear at the world origin)
 * Server browser showed duplicate servers
 * Server browser player sorting didn't work correctly
 * Ordering your team to disable something while they were restraining people (or collecting evidence) would cause them to stop restraining targets (or collecting evidence), and vice versa.

## GAMEPLAY ##
  * Maps may now alter themselves based on difficulty level, for instance adding more suspects or traps in Elite difficulty. Only a few maps use this feature currently.
  * You can now lock doors using the toolkit. Suspects cannot flee as easily through locked doors (they need to unlock them first)
  * The toolkit interface no longer shows up for doors that cannot be locked
  * Tasing your fellow officer and tripping traps now incurs a penalty
  * Tweaked limb damage slightly. JHP does more "expansion" damage to account for drag.
  * Incapacitation occurs at 30 health instead of 20.
  * Using your Shout button on a restrained suspect will taunt them. Examples include "You have the right to remain silent," etc. Doesn't do anything, it's just an easter egg. Warning: The suspect may have some unkind words for you in return.
  * Likewise, this works on restrained civilians as well. "It'll be okay," etc.
  * Suspects now have a slight delay when firing upon the player.
  * (Non-Insane/Non-Polite) suspects take twice as long before shooting hostages
  * Added a new quality: Polite. Any suspect archetype with this quality won't attempt to shoot hostages.
  * Added a new quality: Insane. Any suspect archetype with this quality will shoot hostages *much* faster (basically instantly) and ignores distance checks.
  * Grenades and wedges now go back to your last used weapon after using one, instead of switching back to the flashbang.

## GUI ##
  * Training mission returns! New Features from the Expansion are gone.
  * "Disable Initial Dispatch" option in Audio Settings lets you skip the initial dispatches.

# HOW TO PLAY IN MULTIPLAYER #

## Using GameRanger (preferred) ##
BOTH PLAYERS will need to do the following:
Download and install GameRanger. It can be found at http://gameranger.com
Next, GameRanger will automatically detect SWAT 4 and SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate, if all is OK.
You may need to manually detect these, if GameRanger doesn't do it for you.
You will need to rename the LaunchSEF.exe in SEF/Extras to SWAT4X.exe so Gameranger will recognize it. (It's named LaunchSEF.exe so that it isn't automatically detected!)
Then, you will need to modify the Stetchkov Syndicate game in Gameranger so it points to the Swat4X.exe file in SEF/Extras/Swat4X.exe.

THE HOST will need to do the following:
Create a game room, as a SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate game. (TIP: if this is going to be a publicly joinable game, be sure to mention it's using the SEF mod and specify the version!)
When enough players have joined, press the Start Game button. This will launch the game. From here, go to the Host Game menu and start up a server.
Important Note: Do not launch as a dedicated server while using GameRanger.
The other players will automatically connect to your game while you are loading the map.

THE CLIENT will need to do the following:
Join a public game, or your friend's game. That's all you really need to do.

### TROUBLESHOOTING ###
**NOTE: If you have the mod installed incorrectly, LaunchSEF.exe won't work!**
Make sure you have the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Redistributable. It is required to run LaunchSEF.exe and other applications. Download it here: 

64-bit operating system: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746572
32-bit operating system: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746571

If GameRanger "aborts" when it launches, you may have some application (antivirus?) interfering with LaunchSEF.exe. If this happens, copy all .exe and .dll files from ContentExpansion/System into SEF/System and point GameRanger to the Swat4X.exe that is in SEF/System. This is kind of an ultra last resort option however!

## Traditional Method (TCP/IP) ##
SWAT: Elite Force v4 was the first version of this mod to allow for multiplayer play. v5 introduced Campaign CO-OP and allowed for publishing of games to Swat4Stats without a CD-key (removing DRM that GOG didn't).

If you want to join a game:
If the game you want is not hosted via LAN, then you will need the SWAT4Stats server browser plugin. It's available at http://swat4stats.com - make sure you get the TSS version. 
After it is installed, your server list will show all of the servers, including the ones that are on different mods. Just join the one you want. There are a number of 24/7 SEF servers out there.
If the game you want is hosted via LAN, or you cannot find the server in the list, you will need the host's external IP address (have the host look this up on http://myexternalip.com). You can then join the game from the Join Game menu using the IP address.

If you want to host a game:
First, you will need to open some ports on your router: 10480 - 10483, TCP/UDP. If you aren't sure how to do this, the following article explains it well: https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/
OPTIONAL: If you want your game to be publicly visible on the master server list (on swat4stats), you will need to install the Swat4Stats server browser plugin, available at http://swat4stats.com - You'll also want to set your game to be "Internet" and not "LAN" for this to work.
If you aren't playing an Internet/Swat4Stats enabled game, you will need your external IP address for other players to connect. You can look this up on http://myexternalip.com
Lastly, you need to determine what type of game you want to play. Regular CO-OP is handled through the Host Game menu ingame, but Campaign CO-OP is done through the Career menu - select a campaign and hit Career CO-OP. The "Equipment" panel will change to a "Settings" panel where you can configure a password, etc just like in Host Game.
Once you have selected your map settings and have started the server at least once, you can quickly launch a server (without going ingame) by using the Dedicated Server.bat file. You can then join the server from the Join Server menu.

## Admin System ##
Server hosts should NOT use MarkMod, SES Mod, Gez Mod, or Snitch for admin features. Those mods can introduce glitches, bugs, or crashes or break some of the features of SWAT: Elite Force. Instead, SEF includes its own admin mod which aims to combine a lot of the best features of those mods. If you are pining for a particular feature of one of those, let me know and I will work on adding it!

Administrator permissions are doled out through the use of "roles." Everyone by default is assigned to the Guest role; it is not recommended that you give the Guest role very many powers, if any at all. A player can only have one role at a time. Each role should have a unique password associated with it. To log in to a role, click on the "Admin Login" button and enter the password associated with the desired role.

Admin Roles should be assigned through the Host Game menu, when setting up the server settings.

Additionally, SEF also has an MOTD system. The only way (currently) to configure this is through the use of editing INI files. Open SEF/System/Swat4XDedicatedServer.ini. In the section titled `[SwatGame.SwatAdmin]` (at the bottom), add your MOTD lines by the following:

```
AutoActions=(Delay=NumSeconds,ExecuteText="Command")
```

Replace NumSeconds with the number of seconds (decimal number) before the command will be executed, and "Command" with the command text. The command text can be "print " followed by a message to print a string to chat, or "ac " followed by an admin command to execute that command.

As a trivial example, this will print three lines of text every 10 minutes:

```
AutoActions=(Delay=600.0,ExecuteText="[c=FFFFFF]Welcome to my server![\\c]")
AutoActions=(Delay=0.5,ExecuteText="[c=FFFFFF]I hope you have fun![\\c]]")
AutoActions=(Delay=0.5,ExecuteText="[c=FFFFFF]Please be nice to others![\\c]")
```

WebAdmin defaults to port 6000. You can access it in a web browser by going to: http://<external ip>:6000/
On the host machine, this can be reached from http://127.0.0.1:6000/


# VERSION HISTORY #

#### v6.3

ATTENTION to server admins: Your permissions are now handled in Swat4XDedicatedServer.ini !!
Move your admin lines in SwatGuiState.ini to Swat4XDedicatedServer.ini *before* patching your game, otherwise your role information will be lost!

 - Added a new weapon: Suppressed P90
 - The Uzi, TEC-9 and AKM have flashlights now. (The TEC-9 always did, and does not have a modified model)
 - Added a new option in multiplayer: Show kill messages. When this checkbox is ticked, arrests, kills, incapacitations, and player deaths are shown.
 - Penalty messages in multiplayer now show up as chat messages, and don't hide the chat when shown. (The penalty message in Singleplayer remains the same)
 - Added a new ingame Admin panel. From this panel, you can now kick, ban, go to the next map, etc. All players can use it, but only actions which can be carried out by their current role will be selectable.
 - Added a new WebAdmin panel. The WebAdmin can currently only be used to chat with players and check the server status.
 - New Admin privilege: Lock/Unlock teams.
 - New Admin privilege: Lock/Unlock a player's team.
 - New Admin privilege: Force all players to red/blue
 - New Admin privilege: Force a player to red/blue
 - New Admin privilege: Mute a player
 - New Admin privilege: Promote a player to leader
 - New Admin privilege: Kill a player
 - Admin data is now saved in Swat4XDedicatedServer.ini instead of SwatGuiState.ini
 - Adjusted a lot of the training mission text to better integrate TSS and SEF features.
 - The LaunchSEF.bat script will now check to make sure that the mod is installed correctly before launching. If it is not, it will give a detailed explanation as to how to fix the problem.

#### v6.2
This is a quick fix patch to address some bugs.

 - Slight optimizations and tweaks
 - Fixed SEF bug: Crash in multiplayer when using certain loadouts
 - Fixed SEF bug: Weird leg movement speed in multiplayer when using certain loadouts
 - Fixed TSS bug: Can sometimes reload the same magazine back into the weapon, in certain conditions
 - Fixed TSS bug: The password dialog box (on Admin Login) didn't support all characters


#### v6.1

 - The accuracy system has been overhauled entirely. Weapons are easier to aim in general now.
 - Added an admin system to the game, featuring customizable roles and an MOTD system. For more information, check out the "Admin System" section of "HOW TO PLAY IN MULTIPLAYER."
 - A new mechanic has been added: Empathy Modifiers. Whenever you stun a target with a less-lethal piece of equipment (taser, pepper spray, beanbags, stinger grenades, punching, ... but not CS gas, flashbangs or pepperball gun), there is a chance that nearby civilians will feel the same morale modification. This will make it much less tedious to pepper spray all civilians in a room on maps like Mt. Threshold Research Center or A-Bomb Nightclub, where there are many uncompliant civilians.
 - Bulk now affects your weapon switching and reloading speed. Having less bulk means that you will reload your weapons faster and switch between equipment faster.
 - Added a new button, 'Pick Random Map', to the All Missions mission selection screen. Clicking the button will pick a random map to play. (You can click it over and over again until you find a map that you would like.)
 - Added a Map Filter combobox to the Host Game menu. You can filter maps in the list by their source (All Maps, Custom Maps or Stock Maps)
 - When hosting a game, you can now enable/disable the timer at the beginning or end of a map.
 - Redid the lighting on Brewer County Courthouse
 - A LOT of cut speech was restored, including: "arrested" lines by the player and AI officers, lines when the player goes rogue, AI responses to commands, AI responses to dead suspects, civilian lines when shot at, and a lot of the FunTime drug dealer lines
 - Named speakers from the TSS missions will now be labeled as such in their subtitles. For example, Andrew Norman will appear as "Andrew Norman" instead of "Male Suspect" (*). Band Members from Sellers Street Auditorium are labeled as such, and aren't "Male Civilian"
 - More blood will appear when shooting something
 - Suspects are now considered threats when they move towards a hostage for the purpose of threatening them.
 - Reduced suspect and civilian field of view (120 -> 80)
 - Increased officer field of view (120 -> 180)
 - Officers now turn faster, at the same speed suspects do.
 - Officers will no longer report that they are busy when issued an order.
 - Officers react faster to suspects.
 - Officers will no longer take cover if they are very close to a suspect
 - Officers use the same take-cover time as highly-skilled suspects do
 - Officers will clear rooms quicker
 - Officers will listen to (and respond to) sounds even when they have a current enemy
 - Suspects drop their weapons when cowering
 - Suspects are no longer a threat when cowering

 - Fixed ambient sounds and scripted conversations on Meat Barn Restaurant
 - Fixed multiplayer spawn points on Brewer County Courthouse
 - Fixed SEF bug: Wild Gunner delay not working (fixed for real this time)
 - Fixed SEF bug: Breaching ammo would never breach the door. (It now has a 50% chance to breach a metal door, and 75% chance to breach a wooden door, unless a Breaching Shotgun is used)
 - Fixed SEF bug: Some Sovereign Citizen lines did not play correctly
 - Fixed SEF bug: Magazine count display on equipment panels only showed 2 digits (so pepperball only displayed as "20")
 - Fixed SEF bug: A suspect or civilian who was cuffed and then reported, then incapacitated or killed, would count as "failed to report downed suspect" even though they were already reported.
 - Fixed SEF bug: Using the "say" command in the dedicated server or MarkMods WebAdmin panel would crash the server
 - Fixed SEF bug: Deleting a campaign wouldn't wipe its stats or permadeath status, so creating another one of the same name would result in bugs
 - Fixed SEF bug: M4A1 Suppressed in third person had a glowing silencer
 - Fixed SEF bug: HK33 had wrong model in third person
 - Fixed SEF bug: MP5SSD6 had fingers covering the iron sights
 - Fixed SEF bug: Creating a QMM with no civilians lead to a maximum score of 90/100 due to a bug in the way All Civilians Unharmed score was calculated
 - Fixed TSS bug: Spoken lines by TOC on TSS missions would cut off if the player used the shout button
 - Fixed TSS bug: Some incorrect subtitles
 - Fixed TSS bug: Using the Bulgarian Drug Worker as a suspect in QMM will no longer cause sound bugs


### v6 ###

#### MAJOR FEATURES ####

- First person improvements!
  * By hitting the zoom key, you will transition into (fully 3D) Iron Sights! While in Iron Sights, you suffer less recoil and firing your weapon affects your accuracy less. The visual representation of iron sights can be disabled in favor of the old behavior in the Game Options menu, if you prefer.
  * Lightsticks are thrown like grenades now. Chuck them across the room, or just drop them at your feet!
  * Tactical equipment (grenades, lightsticks, C2, pepper spray, wedges) now show how many you have in reserve on the HUD.
- Equipment changes!
  * The breaching tab has been removed and a sixth tactical slot has been added.
  * C2 is now considered a tactical piece of equipment, and the breaching shotgun is a weapon. The breaching shotgun will breach a door 100% of the time, unlike other shotguns where this chance is random.
  * New silenced versions of base game weapons: Suppressed M4A1, Suppressed UMP and Suppressed G36C. More weight and bulk, but won't tip off suspects in adjacent rooms when fired.
  * Added a cut weapon from the game: The M1Super90.
  * 3-packs of Wedges, Flashbangs, CS Gas and Stingers have been added. They have 3 tactical items, with the equivalent weight and bulk of five of those items.
  * All shotguns now have Frangible Breaching Ammo, which doesn't ricochet or overpenetrate a door.
  * The gas mask is now called the Respirator and no longer restricts field of view. A new gas mask, the S10 Helmet, has been added!
- Command interface overhaul!
  * New commands: SEARCH AND SECURE, SECURE ALL, RESTRAIN ALL, and DISABLE ALL.
     * SECURE ALL, RESTRAIN ALL, and DISABLE ALL will secure all evidence, restrain all compliant hostages/suspects, or disable all devices in a radius around the player, OR everything in the same room (whichever is farther, if the mission is NOT complete). SEARCH AND SECURE combines all three of these commands.
  * The lightstick commands got moved back to the DEPLOY submenu, and all of the DEPLOY commands were reorganized based on how frequently they are used.
  * The Classic Command Interface (CCI) has had all of its commands reorganized to play better.
- More AI improvements!
  * High skilled suspects are much more dangerous.
  * Enemies have figured out how to equip heavy armor! Your AP rounds will be very important.
- Menu improvements!

  * You can now select which entrance to use in an All Missions campaign.
  * You can now vote (in multiplayer) to end the current map, or to go to the next map. You can also vote in Career CO-OP mode.

  * The main menu now has a link to Discord and the Wiki and shows the mod version.

- Cut content restored: Blood spray texture that was not used [kf]

- Fixed SEF bug: Sniper rifle viewport not controllable on listen servers

### v5.2 ###
- Fixed a very frequent crash in multiplayer that was introduced in 5.1
- Corrected glitches in the grenade animations which appeared at high FOVs
- Tweaked the speed of the surrender animation so it plays slower (thanks to kevinfoley for this change)


### v5.1 ###

#### MAIN CHANGES
- Some additional improvements to speech commands (thanks to kevinfoley for these changes):
  * You can now report things to TOC using your voice!
  * Improved the speech commands with CS gas
  * A new SpeechCommands.md file has been provided which lists all the things you can say to trigger voice commands.
- Adjusted the weapon accuracies (see Weapon Changes for more information)
- Reduced the drag of beanbag ammo by 25% so it can hit more distant targets
- AI will now wait before entering a room after a gas grenade goes off. The amount of time depends on what equipment your officers have equipped. (thanks to kevinfoley for this change)
- Halved the melee range (170 -> 85)
- Reduced the damage done by torso shots against all targets
- Increased the damage done by 9mm AP and .223 ammunition
- Suspects have a chance to drop their weapon immediately upon surrendering, making it less likely to shoot them accidentally
- Added a "grace period" to compliance. If a suspect becomes compliant and you accidentally shoot them within a moment of their surrender, no penalty is ensued.
- Restored cut dialogue: Officers will report when they've lost sight of a suspect.
- Fixed SEF bug: Investigating enemies were considered threats (for the purposes of penalties and officer AI)
- Fixed SEF bug: Fleeing suspects who were attacking were *not* considered threats (for the purposes of penalties and officer AI)

- Fixed SEF bug: The AI could "miss" and not break a door with the breaching shotgun. They will now fire up to two times, and if they miss both times, the door will break on its own.
- Fixed SEF bug: Colt Accurized Rifle, HK69, HK33, M16A1, AKM, G36C and Commando Rifle had wrong animations for AI-controlled officers
- Fixed SEF bug: M16A1 had 30 round magazine for JSP and JHP ammo and 20 round magazine for others (now it's 20 rounds for all)
- Fixed SEF bug: Manager on Meat Barn had a ridiculously high amount of morale (3.0)
- Fixed TSS/SEF bug: Suspects could be "juked" by running in a circle around them and/or spamming crouch, which would foil their AI and prevent them from firing. This was more pronounced in SEF since enemies take longer to fire their weapon.
- Fixed TSS bug: Punching a restrained suspect would make them stand up.
- Fixed TSS bug: Punching while changing weapons (or when finishing an arrest) would cause weird bugs, including turning your weapon invisible and going into a T-pose
- Fixed TSS bug: Compliant/arrested "Wild Gunner" AIs (the kind with M249 SAWs) would be sweeping back and forth still, which looked odd (they still do this while they are stunned, but it'll require some reorganization of the code to fix this properly)

### v5 ###

#### MAJOR FEATURES ####

### v4.1 ###
This is a hotfix patch to address some common issues that have been raised.
- The taunt feature has been improved significantly. You now have to be aiming at the target in order to taunt at them.
- The FOV slider no longer freezes the game, and resolution options should now save correctly. (Review the updated installation instructions if it does not work.) Navigating away from the Video Options menu will bring up a "Please Wait..." dialogue as it saves settings.
- Widescreen improvements; the GUI has been tweaked so that certain widescreen resolutions (mostly 16:9 ones) won't have disappearing elements in the GUI. Ultrawide is still unsupported at the moment and there might be a few issues I missed.
- Sellers St. Auditorium no longer displays the Colt Carbine text for New Equipment; it displays the UMP text correctly instead.
- Fixed an issue that caused magazine counts to "reset" themselves when switching away from a shotgun
- Speech Command Interface improvements:
  * Now distinguishes between "Mark with Lightstick" and "Drop Lightstick" properly
  * Added missing commands: SECURE EVIDENCE, RESTRAIN and all of the LEADER THROW commands.
  * Added a new keybind to the Key Config menu: Toggle Speech Commands. This button turns off/on the speech command interface; which is good for streamers.
  * You can now shout for compliance at civilians, suspects, etc using your voice. Try "Police!", "Put your hands up!", "Drop your weapons!" or for roleplay purposes, "Police! Search warrant!"
  * Commands involving "stinger" now use "sting" since this was often confused by the engine for "taser"
  * Various other misc improvements
- Fixed chat in multiplayer pregame having the wrong number of lines (thanks to KevinL and Sokol for this fix)
- Updated wedge description to explain the difference between using a wedge and locking a door.

### v4 ###

#### MAJOR FEATURES ####
- Introducing, Extra Missions! These are a second, Irrational-quality campaign of missions for you to explore.
  * You will need to create a second campaign (in the menu) and select Extra Missions from the dropdown box (SWAT4 + TSS are selected by default)
  * The first one, Meat Barn Restaurant, is an altered version of the multiplayer-exclusive Meat Barn Restaurant. Major changes were made to the layout to make it easier in Singleplayer and CO-OP.
- New system: Weight/Bulk. Instead of speed and use time being dictated by armor equipped, it's now based on two variables: Weight and Bulk.
  * There are two bars on the loadout screen to help visualize how much weight/bulk you have, along with the real values.
  * WEIGHT will slow you down. It is measured in kilograms, as a measure of how heavy things are.
  * BULK will make things take longer to use. It is a percentage ingame, with real measurements behind it - it is a measure of surface area of your gear.
  * Generally weight and bulk go in tandem, but there are some differences. The Desert Eagle is heavier than the Python, but the Python is more bulky.
- Weapons have been totally altered, both internally (how they function) and externally (how they play).
  * All weapons have reworked accuracy, recoil and handling characteristics using realistic weights and lenght for each. Light, shorter weapons like pistols and SMGs now suffer less penalties for movement and injuries, whereas long, heavier weapons like assault rifles and shotguns are more accurate and powerful.
  * The ammo bag tactical aid has been removed. Instead you can now customize the amount of ammo you want to bring, to fine-tune your weight and bulk.
  * Weapons have been given more realistic rates of fire and muzzle velocities. In terms of gameplay, higher muzzle velocity = more potential for penetration. Most weapons got reduced muzzle velocity, except for the P90, TEC-9 and UMP.
  * Bullets can now ricochet off of hard surfaces, such as concrete, stone, bricks, etc. Ricochets occur from FMJ and buckshot rounds. (This feature will be improved as more research is done)
  * All secondary weapons are available in primary weapon slots.
  * Heavy Armor now acts differently. It completely protects against conventional weapons, but may become damaged over time. At 0% health, it will only be as effective as Light Armor.
  * The Less Lethal shotgun is much more dangerous. Don't fire it at point blank range; give the beanbags some travel time, and don't aim for the head...
- New set of commands in singleplayer: LEADER THROW. These commands allow you to use a grenade instead of your AI companions.
  * For hold commands, when the INITIATE command is done, officers will blow/open the door, and will only enter after you use a grenade. Therefore, you only need one grenade for a double entry.
  * These commands work for both thrown grenades and the grenade launcher, and they're "one-command-fits all" (OPEN, LEADER & CLEAR accepts flashbangs, CS gas and sting grenades without needing to pick in the menu)
- Many changes to both the officer and suspect AI to make them both better.
- The console has been improved.
- Completely redid all of the campaign progression/unlocks.
- You can now lock doors using the toolkit.

#### MINOR FEATURES / FULL CHANGES ####
- Added Meat Barn Restaurant extra mission
- Fixed CO-OP and tested. It works now, honest! Although it will see some improvements.
- AI improvements: SWAT officers no longer stare down noncompliant civilians for days
- AI improvements: SWAT officers will no longer form "death funnels" as easily in doors - they will engage with suspects while moving through doors.
- AI improvements: Suspects are more likely to play a Get-Hit animation when they are injured and are less accurate in general
- AI improvements: Suspects will no longer shoot instantaneously at SWAT officers. There is a small delay, dependent on skill level.
- AI improvements: Suspects will now shoot at SWAT officers while on the move. The chance is dependent on the skill level of the suspect.
- Fixed TSS bug/AI Improvements: Known locked/wedged doors weren't being taken into account when a suspect evaluates if it should flee.
- Fixed TSS bug: Can save loadouts to work around the campaign unlocks (It will bring up a dialog box informing you that the loadout you want uses invalid equipment)
- Fixed TSS bug: Glitchy arrests with No Armor
- Fixed TSS bug: Optiwand glitchy in multiplayer when near doors (unverified)
- Fixed TSS bug: Pregame not showing HTML styling of server name

- Fixed SEF bug: Invisible traps in CO-OP
- Fixed SEF bug: Invisible drug bags in CO-OP

- Equipment is now affected by Weight and Bulk. Weight, which represents how heavy your equipment is, slows your character down, and Bulk, which represents how large your equipment is, slows down your actions.
- The toolkit can now be used to lock doors.
- Added an FOV slider (Video Options) and a Mouse Smoothing checkbox (Controls Settings)
- The toolkit interface no longer shows up for doors that cannot be locked (e.g, all of the doors on St. Micheal's Medical Center)
- FMJ and buckshot can now ricochet off of hard surfaces
- Bullets are now affected by drag; they will lose momentum (and therefore lethality) over long distances. JHP is more susceptible to drag than FMJ rounds.
- Heavy Armor now has "health". It will protect against rifle rounds almost perfectly but will lose that ability with successive shots.
- JHP does slightly more bullet-expansion ("internal damage") damage to account for drag.
- Restored cut content: AI-controlled officers will now report when they spot a civilian
- Restored cut content: Suspects will now yell loudly as they shoot at doors
- Redid all of the campaign progression/unlocks
- Added "Take Screenshot" option to controls menu
- Minor changes to the compliance system (see the detailed section below for a full list of changes)
- Civilians are now not ridiculously noncompliant like they were before
- Incapacitation health increased from 20 to 30, so incapacitation is more likely
- All pistols are selectable in primary weapon slots.
- CO-OP damage modifier reduced (2.0x -> 1.5x, same as Elite difficulty) and Easy damage modifier increased (0.5x -> 1.0x, same as Normal difficulty)
- Ammo Bandolier item removed
- VIP Colt M1911 removed
- Officers get (by default) 3 primary magazines and 5 secondary magazines. The only exception is Jackson, who gets 25 shotgun shells.
- You can no longer edit your equipment in Multiplayer while you are ready. Unready yourself first.
- You can no longer ready in Multiplayer while your equipment is over weight or bulk.
- If your equipment is over weight in multiplayer, it will be replaced with the default loadout.
- Mapmakers now have the ability for Rosters (bombs/enemies/hostages/etc) to be based on difficulty level.
- The scoring system has been changed. There is no longer a bonus for no suspects incapacitated or killed. Elite difficulty now requires 90 instead of 95 score to complete.
- Moved a few strings from SwatProcedures.ini to SwatProcedures.int so they can be localized correctly
- The Host Game menu no longer loads all of the maps in one go. Instead, the menu will load quickly, and parse all of the maps while in the menu. It will stutter for a bit while it loads all the maps; this is normal.

- Console upgrades: The console will show a log of commands used and show the output of commands
