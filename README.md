# INTRODUCTION #

SWAT 4 is a fantastic game. It took all of the shortcomings of SWAT 3 - mainly the poor GUI and lack of realism and made it into a nicely packaged product.

Unfortunately it's very apparent that this game was rushed. There's tons of bugs, especially in multiplayer, and a cursory glance at the files reveals loads of missing content that never made the final cut of the game.
I spoke to one of the programmers - Terrance Cohen - through email, about the game. They received a great deal of input from SWAT and police alike to make the most realistic game that they could but ultimately had to cut quite a bit of their original vision down to make the game more appealing towards...well, gamers.
I think I could do better.
There are very many glaring inaccuracies with the game. For starters, the game doesn't penalize you for killing hostages with the snipers, which I think is silly. Suspects have a much greater variety of behaviors and are made to be more realistic. There's some rather baffling logic here. You can't equip your officers with gas masks and the ammo pouch doesn't display what actually happens with your weapons.

Enter SWAT Elite Force.
I originally wanted to try and market this mod as a police officer trainer, but I stopped getting interest in the project after encountering some bugs. I picked the game up again and started playing on |ESF| and remembered this mod. So, I started work on it again and took a much harder look at the engine, trying to figure out how everything works, and resumed work on it. I think I've got it to the point where people would really like it.

I wish I could do more with the game. I'm not an artist by any means, so a lot of the other things that I wish I could do (TASER rounds for shotguns, fixing a lot of the bad bump maps and flat shaded textures) aren't in the pipes. I do plan on dabbling with maps at some point, so there may be a custom campaign. I may include some community maps as part of the new campaign.

Since Version 3, the mod has gained a large following. I've since been able to enlist the help of others to work on the mod, and it's become a team effort in improving the game.

# HOW TO INSTALL #
Copy the folder containing this folder (SEF) into your SWAT 4 directory (the one containing Content and ContentExpansion).
By default this folder is located in C:/Program Files (x86)/SWAT 4 or C:/Program Files (x86)/Sierra/SWAT 4

!!! CAUTION !!!
Do not extract the SEF folder *into* your Content or ContentExpansion folders (and therefore overwrite things), otherwise the mod will not work correctly.

To run the game, use the "Launch SEFMod.bat" file. To run SWATEd, use the "Launch SwatEd.bat" file.
You can make a shortcut to these .bat files for more convenience.

The mod can be removed by deleting the SEF folder from your hard drive.

NOTE: You may run into an issue with the game not saving your settings, or throwing an assertion failure at times in the Settings menu. This is mostly a problem with Windows Vista and up; try giving the folder write permissions or "Total Control". Alternatively you can make your SWAT4x.exe run in administrator mode.

# CHANGES, SUMMARIZED #
	* The Stetchkov Syndicate and base game missions are compressed into one campaign. As in The Stetchkov Syndicate, some equipment will need to be unlocked.
	* New campaign options! Now you will have a good reason to create more than one campaign...
		** A new EXTRA MISSIONS campaign. These are curated missions which have voice acting, full maps, and scripting, and they are designed to feel like part of the original game.
		** Now you can create an ALL MISSIONS campaign. This pulls all of the installed maps from your hard drive and makes them into a campaign, albeit without briefings. Great for use with an installed custom map pack, such as the Mega Map Pack!
		** ..and of course, the original SWAT 4 + TSS missions are a third campaign option.
		** PERMADEATH. There are two Permadeath options, for the extra challenge. AI Permadeath makes slain SWAT officers never come back, and Player Permadeath ends your campaign once you die.
		** CAMPAIGN CO-OP. This feature allows you to play any (non All Missions, non Permadeath) campaign in multiplayer. Help your friends complete their campaigns!
	* Important QOL (quality-of-life) and playability features that are essential to playing the game.
		** There is an FOV slider and Mouse Smoothing disable checkbox. Also, widescreen resolutions are available in the menu and are (mostly) free of bugs.
	* Suspects employ a greater variety of tactics. "Insane" suspects will shoot without hesitation at hostages. "Polite" ones on the other hand, won't make this a priority.
		** Suspects will also try to shoot at you as they're fleeing.
		** Suspects now employ a "random patrol", "wander" strategy and don't stick to their assigned rooms as often.
	* Smarter Officer AI!
		** Upon restraining a target, SWAT officers will now report it to TOC automatically!
		** SWAT officers are much more efficient at clearing rooms
		** SWAT officers can now take cover like suspects do (including leaning around corners)
	* Traps. This is a huge cut feature from the game. Some doors may be trapped with bombs or alarms, and you'll need to adjust your approach to deal with it.
		** This is a small thing but it has huge ramifications. Since some doors will be trapped, you will need to take alternate routes instead of using the same strategy every time.
	* New secondary objective: collect drug evidence. Static drug bags have been replaced with new ones that can be collected.
		** The bags count towards the "Secure All Evidence" procedure.
	* More equipment options. This includes a few cut equipment items, such as riot helmets.
		** AI-controlled officers can carry more lightsticis.
		** The player can carry armor and all helmet options in singleplayer.
		** The player can select how many magazines they would like to bring in the mission.
		** There is a new Advanced Information Panel in the loadout menu that lets you view information such as manufacturer, magazine size, etc.
		** Heavy armor now shows a health percentage on the HUD. Heavy armor at 100% health can stop almost any bullet in the game, but as it takes damage, it loses the ability to protect you. It can only be shattered by bullets and sabot slugs, not buckshot or other rounds.
		** All secondary weapons equippable as primaries, and some primaries equippable as secondaries.
	* Equipment is also much more realistic.
		** All of your equipment factors into two meters: WEIGHT and BULK. Weight dictates your speed and is a measure of how heavy your equipment is. Bulk affects interaction speed (C2 placing/wedging door/toolkit use, but NOT restraining) and measures how big your equipment is.
		** TASERs can kill or incapacitate drug users, the elderly, or people with compromised health.
		** Less Lethal shotguns also realistically are lethal at close range. Put some distance between you and your target.
		** Flashbangs can injure. The explosion they set off can also blow up objects such as Pipe-Bombs now much easier. They also stun people for a shorter duration.
		** CS gas affects a wider area, takes longer to disperse, and affects people for longer. It has less of an effect on morale however. It also affects the player on Singleplayer, so wear a gas mask.
		** C2 is much more dangerous. You might want to bring that breaching shotgun after all.
		** Bullets of certain types (FMJ, buckshot) can now ricochet off of hard surfaces such as concrete, dirt, and water. Use caution.
		** Bullets are now subject to drag; they lose damage over distance.
		** All equipment has been modified to use real values.
	* Commands can be issued using your voice. To enable this feature, tick 'Use Speech Recognition' in the Audio Options.
		** Functions exactly the same as in the Speech Recognition Improvement mod by MulleDK9. Not all commands from that mod are present however.
	* Commands are easier to give with a new Graphic Command Interface with lots of submenus instead of a single long list.
		** You can now issue BREACH commands on unlocked doors.
		** New CHECK FOR TRAPS command allows your AI companions to check doors for those all-important traps.
		** LEADER THROW commands: Now you can be the one to throw the grenade!
		** Lightsticks are broken into two commands: DROP LIGHTSTICK (where you order the nearest AI officer to drop a lightstick at their feet) and MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK (where you order an AI to drop a lightstick at what you're aiming at)
	* Harsher penalties. Incapacitated hostages and suspects now need to be reported to TOC; deadly force is more scrutinized and can be incurred by more means (AI controlled officers using C2 and snipers are two good examples)
		** The game seems to take some wild liberties as to what qualifies as a passing mission. You could shoot all of the suspects illegally (in some cases without getting any penalty) on Food Wall on Hard and still beat it. You would be FIRED if you did this in real life.
		** A person being incapacitated is a big deal, and an ambulance would need to be ordered. Failing to disclose this could put their lives in jeopardy, so it makes sense for this to be a penalty. It did this for officers though (?) which I found odd.
		** The game reveals much more information to you. A warning will display when you have made a penalty, and a message will show when you have completed an objective.
	* Multiplayer improvements!
		** Snipers are now available in multiplayer.

# KNOWN ISSUES #
  * Yes, the game is HARD AS NAILS. It's supposed to be. It's a police simulator and meant to train SWAT operators.
  * Not working when you launch the .bat? The whole SEF folder is supposed to be copied to your SWAT 4 folder. Please review the HOW TO INSTALL section.
  * You cannot select Barricaded Suspects, VIP Escort or Rapid Deployment. Intentional! This mod is only meant for CO-OP play and we don't balance the equipment to suit those modes.
  * TOC won't reply when an AI-controlled officer reports something. There's lots of code that needs to be altered to make this work.
  * The game sometimes freezes during loading. Hit ENTER a few times and it will clear itself up. The internal script garbage collector crashes for reasons unknown but it's completely harmless.
  * Seems to crash in specific circumstances on doors, such as trying to blow a door that's currently being closed. Not sure if it's an original game bug.
  * Officers sometimes ignore orders, you might have to issue a command two or three times. Problem of the original game.
  * Officers sometimes ignore orders and say something like "I'm busy." This is a problem of the original game; they sometimes can see suspects where the player can't.
  * Throws an assertion when an officer ordered to restrain a civilian is ordered to disarm a bomb. Nothing I've changed would've caused it, so again, probably an issue with the original game. Also harmless.
  * MULTIPLAYER: "gui_tex package version mismatch" --> Make sure you are running under International language. Sometimes it defaults itself to English or some other language. Search for `Language=eng` or `Language=grm` in SEF/System/Swat4x.ini and make sure it's set to `Language=int`

# OTHER MINOR CHANGES #

## GAMEPLAY ##
  * Maps may now alter themselves based on difficulty level, for instance adding more suspects or traps in Elite difficulty. Only a few maps use this feature currently.
  * "Press ESC and debrief to exit the game" now shows on ALL missions, not just Food Wall, Fairfax Residence and Qwik Fuel.
  * In multiplayer you can now unready yourself.
  * Fixed an exploit that allowed player to access early campaign unlocks by saving a loadout and then reloading it in another campaign.
  * You can now lock doors using the toolkit. Suspects cannot flee as easily through locked doors (they need to unlock them first)
  * The toolkit interface no longer shows up for doors that cannot be locked
  * Tasing your fellow officer and tripping traps now incurs a penalty
  * Tweaked limb damage slightly. JHP does more "expansion" damage to account for drag.
  * Incapacitation occurs at 30 health instead of 20.
  * Using your Shout button on a restrained suspect will taunt them. Examples include "You have the right to remain silent," etc. Doesn't do anything, it's just an easter egg. Warning: The suspect may have some unkind words for you in return.
  * Likewise, this works on restrained civilians as well. "It'll be okay," etc.
  * Suspects now have a slight delay when firing upon the player.
  * (Non-Insane/Non-Polite) suspects take twice as long before shooting hostages
  * Added a new quality: Polite. Any suspect archetype with this quality won't attempt to shoot hostages.
  * Added a new quality: Insane. Any suspect archetype with this quality will shoot hostages *much* faster (basically instantly) and ignores distance checks.

### v4.1 ###
This is a hotfix patch to address some common issues that have been raised.
- The taunt feature has been improved significantly. You now have to be aiming at the target in order to taunt at them.
- The FOV slider no longer freezes the game, and resolution options should now save correctly. (Review the updated installation instructions if it does not work.) Navigating away from the Video Options menu will bring up a "Please Wait..." dialogue as it saves settings.
- Widescreen improvements; the GUI has been tweaked so that certain widescreen resolutions (mostly 16:9 ones) won't have disappearing elements in the GUI. Ultrawide is still unsupported at the moment and there might be a few issues I missed.
- Sellers St. Auditorium no longer displays the Colt Carbine text for New Equipment; it displays the UMP text correctly instead.
- Fixed an issue that caused magazine counts to "reset" themselves when switching away from a shotgun
- Speech Command Interface improvements:
  * Now distinguishes between "Mark with Lightstick" and "Drop Lightstick" properly
  * Added missing commands: SECURE EVIDENCE, RESTRAIN and all of the LEADER THROW commands.
  * Added a new keybind to the Key Config menu: Toggle Speech Commands. This button turns off/on the speech command interface; which is good for streamers.
  * You can now shout for compliance at civilians, suspects, etc using your voice. Try "Police!", "Put your hands up!", "Drop your weapons!" or for roleplay purposes, "Police! Search warrant!"
  * Commands involving "stinger" now use "sting" since this was often confused by the engine for "taser"
  * Various other misc improvements
- Fixed chat in multiplayer pregame having the wrong number of lines (thanks to KevinL and Sokol for this fix)
- Updated wedge description to explain the difference between using a wedge and locking a door.

### v4 ###

#### MAJOR FEATURES ####
- Introducing, Extra Missions! These are a second, Irrational-quality campaign of missions for you to explore.
  * You will need to create a second campaign (in the menu) and select Extra Missions from the dropdown box (SWAT4 + TSS are selected by default)
  * The first one, Meat Barn Restaurant, is an altered version of the multiplayer-exclusive Meat Barn Restaurant. Major changes were made to the layout to make it easier in Singleplayer and CO-OP.
- New system: Weight/Bulk. Instead of speed and use time being dictated by armor equipped, it's now based on two variables: Weight and Bulk.
  * There are two bars on the loadout screen to help visualize how much weight/bulk you have, along with the real values.
  * WEIGHT will slow you down. It is measured in kilograms, as a measure of how heavy things are.
  * BULK will make things take longer to use. It is a percentage ingame, with real measurements behind it - it is a measure of surface area of your gear.
  * Generally weight and bulk go in tandem, but there are some differences. The Desert Eagle is heavier than the Python, but the Python is more bulky.
- Weapons have been totally altered, both internally (how they function) and externally (how they play).
  * All weapons have reworked accuracy, recoil and handling characteristics using realistic weights and lenght for each. Light, shorter weapons like pistols and SMGs now suffer less penalties for movement and injuries, whereas long, heavier weapons like assault rifles and shotguns are more accurate and powerful.
  * The ammo bag tactical aid has been removed. Instead you can now customize the amount of ammo you want to bring, to fine-tune your weight and bulk.
  * Weapons have been given more realistic rates of fire and muzzle velocities. In terms of gameplay, higher muzzle velocity = more potential for penetration. Most weapons got reduced muzzle velocity, except for the P90, TEC-9 and UMP.
  * Bullets can now ricochet off of hard surfaces, such as concrete, stone, bricks, etc. Ricochets occur from FMJ and buckshot rounds. (This feature will be improved as more research is done)
  * All secondary weapons are available in primary weapon slots.
  * Heavy Armor now acts differently. It completely protects against conventional weapons, but may become damaged over time. At 0% health, it will only be as effective as Light Armor.
  * The Less Lethal shotgun is much more dangerous. Don't fire it at point blank range; give the beanbags some travel time, and don't aim for the head...
- New set of commands in singleplayer: LEADER THROW. These commands allow you to use a grenade instead of your AI companions.
  * For hold commands, when the INITIATE command is done, officers will blow/open the door, and will only enter after you use a grenade. Therefore, you only need one grenade for a double entry.
  * These commands work for both thrown grenades and the grenade launcher, and they're "one-command-fits all" (OPEN, LEADER & CLEAR accepts flashbangs, CS gas and sting grenades without needing to pick in the menu)
- Many changes to both the officer and suspect AI to make them both better.
- The console has been improved.
- Completely redid all of the campaign progression/unlocks.
- You can now lock doors using the toolkit.

#### MINOR FEATURES / FULL CHANGES ####
- Added Meat Barn Restaurant extra mission
- Fixed CO-OP and tested. It works now, honest! Although it will see some improvements.
- AI improvements: SWAT officers no longer stare down noncompliant civilians for days
- AI improvements: SWAT officers will no longer form "death funnels" as easily in doors - they will engage with suspects while moving through doors.
- AI improvements: Suspects are more likely to play a Get-Hit animation when they are injured and are less accurate in general
- AI improvements: Suspects will no longer shoot instantaneously at SWAT officers. There is a small delay, dependent on skill level.
- AI improvements: Suspects will now shoot at SWAT officers while on the move. The chance is dependent on the skill level of the suspect.
- Fixed TSS bug/AI Improvements: Known locked/wedged doors weren't being taken into account when a suspect evaluates if it should flee.
- Fixed TSS bug: Can save loadouts to work around the campaign unlocks (It will bring up a dialog box informing you that the loadout you want uses invalid equipment)
- Fixed TSS bug: Glitchy arrests with No Armor
- Fixed TSS bug: Optiwand glitchy in multiplayer when near doors (unverified)
- Fixed TSS bug: Pregame not showing HTML styling of server name
- Fixed TSS bug: Glock not selectable in Custom Mission Maker
- Fixed TSS bug: Taser recoil applying to every player on the map
- Fixed TSS bug: Server name field in Multiplayer Setup not matching the actual number of characters that could be used
- Fixed TSS bug: When using Deploy C2 command, AI will pick the lock if they are out of C2
- Fixed TSS bug: TEC-9 not having any reload sound effects
- Fixed TSS bug: Hologen suspects having ridiculously high morale at times
- Fixed SEF bug: Join Game button on menu not appearing
- Fixed SEF bug: Officers picking locks on unlocked doors when ordered to breach and out of C2
- Fixed SEF bug: Riot Helmet not protecting against pepper spray like it's supposed to.
- Fixed SEF bug: Sniper rifle not accurate
- Fixed SEF bug: Wrong resolution in options menu (1600x1050 -> 1680x1050)
- Fixed SEF bug: Wrong window title ("MyMod" -> "SWAT: Elite Force")
- Fixed SEF bug: Invisible traps in CO-OP
- Fixed SEF bug: Invisible drug bags in CO-OP
- Five new commands: LEADER THROW & CLEAR; OPEN, LEADER & CLEAR; OPEN, LEADER & MAKE ENTRY; BREACH, LEADER & CLEAR; BREACH, LEADER & MAKE ENTRY. These commands let you throw the grenade instead of the AI doing it.
- Equipment is now affected by Weight and Bulk. Weight, which represents how heavy your equipment is, slows your character down, and Bulk, which represents how large your equipment is, slows down your actions.
- The toolkit can now be used to lock doors.
- Added an FOV slider (Video Options) and a Mouse Smoothing checkbox (Controls Settings)
- The toolkit interface no longer shows up for doors that cannot be locked (e.g, all of the doors on St. Micheal's Medical Center)
- FMJ and buckshot can now ricochet off of hard surfaces
- Bullets are now affected by drag; they will lose momentum (and therefore lethality) over long distances. JHP is more susceptible to drag than FMJ rounds.
- Heavy Armor now has "health". It will protect against rifle rounds almost perfectly but will lose that ability with successive shots.
- JHP does slightly more bullet-expansion ("internal damage") damage to account for drag.
- Restored cut content: AI-controlled officers will now report when they spot a civilian
- Restored cut content: Suspects will now yell loudly as they shoot at doors
- Redid all of the campaign progression/unlocks
- Added "Take Screenshot" option to controls menu
- Minor changes to the compliance system (see the detailed section below for a full list of changes)
- Civilians are now not ridiculously noncompliant like they were before
- Incapacitation health increased from 20 to 30, so incapacitation is more likely
- All pistols are selectable in primary weapon slots.
- CO-OP damage modifier reduced (2.0x -> 1.5x, same as Elite difficulty) and Easy damage modifier increased (0.5x -> 1.0x, same as Normal difficulty)
- Ammo Bandolier item removed
- VIP Colt M1911 removed
- Officers get (by default) 3 primary magazines and 5 secondary magazines. The only exception is Jackson, who gets 25 shotgun shells.
- You can no longer edit your equipment in Multiplayer while you are ready. Unready yourself first.
- You can no longer ready in Multiplayer while your equipment is over weight or bulk.
- If your equipment is over weight in multiplayer, it will be replaced with the default loadout.
- Mapmakers now have the ability for Rosters (bombs/enemies/hostages/etc) to be based on difficulty level.
- The scoring system has been changed. There is no longer a bonus for no suspects incapacitated or killed. Elite difficulty now requires 90 instead of 95 score to complete.
- Moved a few strings from SwatProcedures.ini to SwatProcedures.int so they can be localized correctly
- The Host Game menu no longer loads all of the maps in one go. Instead, the menu will load quickly, and parse all of the maps while in the menu. It will stutter for a bit while it loads all the maps; this is normal.
- The Host Game menu now STRICTLY enforces CO-OP mode. Lots of options relating to Barricaded Suspects/VIP Escort/Smash and Grab have been removed.
- Console upgrades: The console will no longer close after entering a command (use the ESC key)
- Console upgrades: The console will show a log of commands used and show the output of commands
- Console upgrades: New console command "history"

## COMPLIANCE CHANGES ##
The compliance system has been changed slightly. Civilians are not nearly as noncompliant as before, but all of the changes required their own section.

- Greatly increased the effectiveness of Stinger grenades against Hostage and Suspect morale. They're as good as Tasers now.
- Greatly increased the area of effect for Stinger grenades.
- Doubled the duration of effect for CS gas but greatly reduced its morale modifier
- Slightly increased the effectiveness of Tasers against Suspect morale
- Slightly increased the effectiveness of bullets against Hostage morale
- Slightly reduced the effectiveness of C2 against Hostage morale
- Removed a slight (< 1 second) delay from AI being affected by Stinger and Flashbangs. (it still exists for CS gas)
