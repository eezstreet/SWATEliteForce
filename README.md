# INTRODUCTION #

SWAT 4 is a fantastic, if horrendously bugged product. I've spent countless hours playing the game, mostly in CO-OP on servers new and old, and there always seemed to be a glimmer of potential that has never been truly realized by games that followed it.

The best way to explain SWAT: Elite Force in short is a complete overhaul of the original game. The broken AI is fixed, cut content has been restored, and every weapon is precisely calibrated to its real world counterpart. The main campaign, a combination of the vanilla game and The Stetchkov Syndicate, has a carefully crafted unlock system that you can play through with a friend to complete. If that isn't what you'd prefer, there's also an All Missions campaign which allows you to play through any mission, including custom ones on the hard drive, with any equipment in the game, including some which is multiplayer sepcific. Even after you've completed the campaign, there's various flavors of permadeath to tackle...if you think you're Elite enough...

The gameplay itself has been drastically changed. You can now aim down the sights, and there are now traps to disarm. Doors can have their lock checked with the melee key. Suspects can employ a wide variety of personality types, from your usual, sideways-shooting crook to insane domestic terrorists which murder civilians at whim to heavily armored thugs with light machine guns. Your team is much, much smarter too, and with the restored Speech Recognition feature, you can even order them around with an attached microphone. You'll need the extra speed too, because incapacitated civilians that spawn around the map will die if you aren't quick enough, which will impact your score. The command system has been vastly improved with a new LEADER THROW set of commands that let you be the one to throw the grenade, and SEARCH AND SECURE, which orders your officers to restrain all compliant hostages/suspects and secure all evidence in range. After restraining a suspect or hostage, your team will also report it to TOC.

The equipment system is incredibly robust. There's over 40 pieces of new equipment, some of which was cut from the original game. You'll need to manage your team's weight and bulk. Too much equipment, and an officer will become too overencumbered. By carrying less weight, you and your officers will move faster, and by carrying less bulk, you and your officers will interact with things faster. In singleplayer, you can also pick your team's helmet and body armor, which protect you similar to how they did in multiplayer. The breaching tab has been removed - instead, there are now six tactical slots and the breaching equipment is available as other equipment. There's twice as many ammo options as in the original game, and the choices matter, since new factors like drag (how much momentum the bullet loses over distance) and ricochet potential (how likely a bullet is to bounce off a surface) vary. Grenades and wedges come in 3-packs, at the cost of consuming more weight and bulk. Less lethal equipment is truly less lethal, since tasers may incapacitate or even kill the elderly, those in poor health, or drug users, and beanbags, stingers and flashbangs can be hazardous at close range.

The game is much more approachable as well, with a cleaned up user interface which functions well on modern widescreen resolutions. There's also an FOV slider and a mouse smoothing checkbox, preventing you from having to tinker with game files to accomplish the same thing. Perhaps most importantly, the game actually warns you when you've encountered a penalty.

Initially, I envisioned SWAT: Elite Force as a tactical simulator that could be used to train police officers in a similar vein to Canadian Forces: Direct Action. After peeking at the games files however, I uncovered a wealth of unused content and decided to contact the original developers about the game. Over time, the game became a much larger, insane overhaul. It's been called the best way to play the game by most people, and I'm proud of that. Perhaps you'll find it to be the same.

# HOW TO INSTALL #

Copy the folder containing this folder (SEF) into your SWAT 4 directory (the one containing Content and ContentExpansion).
For the CD copy of the game, this folder is located in C:/Program Files (x86)/SWAT 4 or C:/Program Files (x86)/Sierra/SWAT 4
For the GOG version of the game, it's usually located in C:/GOG Games/SWAT 4

!!! CAUTION !!!
Do not extract the SEF folder *into* your Content or ContentExpansion folders (and therefore overwrite things), otherwise the mod will not work correctly.

To run the game, use the "Launch SEFMod.bat" file. To run SWATEd, use the "Launch SwatEd.bat" file.
You can make a shortcut to these .bat files for more convenience.

The mod can be removed by deleting the SEF folder from your hard drive.

NOTE: You may run into an issue with the game not saving your settings, or throwing an assertion failure at times in the Settings menu. This is mostly a problem with Windows Vista and up; try giving the folder write permissions or "Total Control". Alternatively you can make your SWAT4x.exe run in administrator mode.

# BUILDING FROM SOURCE #

**ATTENTION!** You *cannot* run the game without having the content. You can find the content for the mod [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnIKDNAshMwbnVml6hksfsABRhyq?e=NaCciJ).

If you are instead trying to build the source code, it is fairly straightforward.

 * Clone the source code into your SWAT 4 folder. Your folder structure ought to look very similar to the installed mod, with SWATEliteForce within your SWAT 4 folder.
 * Download the assets from the link above. Unzip the contents into your SWATEliteForce/Content folder. *Do not commit these files if you are using Git.*
 * From here, you can compile the source code with the CompileSource.bat and run the game with the LaunchSEF.bat. The source code will compile to .u files in the System folder.
 * Edit the source code within /Source/ and any ini files within /System/.

The mod's code is primarily written in UnrealScript. You can find a good resource about UnrealScript [here](wiki.beyondunreal.com). (Note, if you can't access this page, try using the Wayback Machine to access it.)

## Contributing to the mod

The best and most direct way to contribute to the mod's programming is by issuing a pull request. Generally, pull requests are best done by forking the mod's code, committing and pushing to your fork, and then issuing a pull request from your repository. It is not the best idea to use GitHub directly for editing, since if you need to make many edits, it will spam email inboxes.

When it comes to code cleanliness, the code standards appear to have been different between the base Unreal engine, vanilla SWAT 4 and vanilla TSS. Specifically:

 * The base Unreal engine does not support the use of the `#ifdef` keyword; this would appear to be a modified version of the engine which supports it.
 * The Stetchkov Syndicate uses spaces instead of tabs for indentation.

That being said, I would like to adhere to these standards as much as possible:

 * Use tabs instead of spaces for indentation. Use spaces instead of tabs when aligning comments across multiple lines.
 * Braces should always be used for `replication`, `while`, `if`/`else`/`else if` (except in replication blocks, where it is illegal), `for`, `defaultproperties`, `state` and any other blocks.
 * Braces should be on their own line. For example:

```java
if(something) { // bad

if(something)
{ // good
```

 * Class names (and `Object`) should start with a capital letter. (UnrealScript is not case sensitive)
 * Class properties should start with a capital letter. Local variables can start with either a lowercase or capital letter. Boolean variables should always start with a lowercase "b"
 * Primitive types (`string`, `int`, etc) should start with a lowercase letter.
 * Reserved words (`local`, `replication`, `if`, etc) should start with a lowercase letter.
 * Functions should start with a capital letter and be written as a verb. `Name` is a bad name for a function, but `GetName()` and `SetName()` are good.
 * Do not use `#ifdef` as support for it is spotty on some text editors which have UnrealScript support.
 * Use `const` whenever possible.
 * Only use `out` variables when it is not possible to use a return value.
 * Use `simulated` on functions that are executed both on the client and server.
 * Don't write both getter and setter functions for private variables unless there is a side effect involved in doing either. Instead, use a public variable. For example:

```java
var public bool bMyVariable;
var private bool bMyBadlyUsedVariable;

function bool GetMyBadlyUsedVariable()
{
	return bMyBadlyUsedVariable;
}

function SetMyBadlyUsedVariable(bool bNewValue)
{
	bMyBadlyUsedVariable = bNewValue;
}
```

Assets have to be sent to myself personally to integrate into the mod.

# CHANGES, SUMMARIZED #

The Stetchkov Syndicate and base game missions are compressed into one campaign. As in The Stetchkov Syndicate, some equipment will need to be unlocked.

**New campaign options! Now you will have a good reason to create more than one campaign...**
 * A new EXTRA MISSIONS campaign. These are curated missions which have voice acting, full maps, and scripting, and they are designed to feel like part of the original game.
 * Now you can create an ALL MISSIONS campaign. This pulls all of the installed maps from your hard drive and makes them into a campaign, albeit without briefings. Great for use with an installed custom map pack, such as the Mega Map Pack!
 * ..and of course, the original SWAT 4 + TSS missions are a third campaign option.
 * PERMADEATH. There are two Permadeath options, for the extra challenge. AI Permadeath makes slain SWAT officers never come back, and Player Permadeath ends your campaign once you die.
 * HARDCORE MODE. Unlocked when the SWAT 4 + TSS campaign has been completed at least once. If a mission is failed once, your campaign is over. You cannot exit a mission prematurely or restart, so keep that in mind!
 * CAMPAIGN CO-OP. This feature allows you to play any (non All Missions, non Permadeath, non Hardcore) campaign in multiplayer. Help your friends complete their campaigns!

**Suspects employ a greater variety of tactics. "Insane" suspects will shoot without hesitation at hostages. "Polite" ones on the other hand, won't make this a priority. Civilians behave more realistically.**
 * Suspects will also try to shoot at you as they're fleeing.
 * Suspects will try to escape, if they are compliant and the player is not watching.
 * Suspects may now employ a "random patrol", "wander" strategy and don't stick to their assigned rooms as often.
 * Suspects have new equipment and may equip heavy armor.
 * Civilians may give up easier if they spot a suspect or a civilian being pepper sprayed, hit with beanbags, etc.
 * Suspects who have no visible weapons will be treated like civilians to SWAT (including in mirror results)

**Smarter Officer AI!**
 * Upon restraining a target, SWAT officers will now report it to TOC automatically!
 * SWAT officers are much more efficient at clearing rooms and don't form "death funnels" at doors as often
 * SWAT officers will smartly avoid looking in the same direction as their teammates while moving if possible to mitigate threat exposure.
 * SWAT officers don't become distracted by civilians and suspects while moving. They will continue following you or going towards their destination (even possibly attacking)
 * SWAT officers will automatically fire beanbags or pepperballs at fleeing suspects, and will keep them equipped as a primary weapon.
 * SWAT officers can now take cover like suspects do (including leaning around corners)
 * SWAT officers won't shoot through civilians to hit their target and are better at aiming with less lethal items in general.
 * SWAT officers can now use grenade launchers, and will use them if a GAS AND CLEAR, OPEN BANG AND CLEAR, etc action is commanded.
 * SWAT officers will drop a lightstick after clearing a room.
 * SWAT officers can now be affected by CS gas, flashbangs, tasers, pepper spray, etc.
 * SWAT officers will use pathfinding distance (instead of Euclidean distance) to determine the closest officer for things such as closing doors, etc, so it correctly picks the closest one.

**Traps. This is a huge cut feature from the game. Some doors may be trapped with bombs or alarms, and you'll need to adjust your approach to deal with it.**
 * This is a small thing but it has huge ramifications. Since some doors will be trapped, you will need to take alternate routes instead of using the same strategy every time.
 * Traps can be disarmed from the other side with the Toolkit.
 * You can order your squad to disarm traps and check for traps with the optiwand.

**New secondary objectives.**
 * Some maps have drug bags which may need to be collected to get a perfect score.
 * Incapacitated civilians may bleed out and die if they aren't reported to TOC in time, which impacts your score slightly.

**More equipment options.**
 * Over 40 new pieces of equipment have been added, including shotguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, tactical gear, and armor.
 * Several existing pieces of equipment have been improved visually.
 * The player can carry armor and all helmet options in singleplayer.
 * The breaching tab is removed and replaced with a sixth tactical slot.
 * The player can select how many magazines they would like to bring in the mission.
 * Heavy armor now shows a health percentage on the HUD. Heavy armor at 100% health can stop almost any bullet in the game, but as it takes damage, it loses the ability to protect you. It can only be shattered by bullets and sabot slugs, not buckshot or other rounds.
 * 3-packs have been added for wedges and grenades.
 * All secondary weapons equippable as primaries, and some primaries now equippable as secondaries.

**Equipment is also much more realistic.**
 * Many of the existing weapon meshes have been replaced with improved ones.
 * Weapons can be aimed down the sights, for better accuracy, using the zoom key.
 * All of your equipment factors into two meters: WEIGHT and BULK. Weight dictates your speed and is a measure of how heavy your equipment is. Bulk affects interaction speed (C2 placing/wedging door/toolkit use, but NOT restraining) and measures how big your equipment is. You can pack No Weapon/No Equipment in some slots to reduce weight and bulk.
 * You can now share some equipment with other players by pressing the melee key. You can also order your AI officers to give you a piece of equipment as well. Currently this only works for tactical tab items and lightsticks.
 * Bullets of certain types (FMJ, buckshot, etc) can now ricochet off of hard surfaces such as concrete, dirt, and water. Use caution.
 * Bullets are now subject to drag; they lose damage over distance.
 * Less lethal equipment is now actually LESS LETHAL. Some equipment (tasers, beanbag shotgun) can incapacitate or kill if used incorrectly.
 * All equipment has been modified to use real values.
 * Recoil is now affected by arm injuries.
 * Lightsticks can be thrown or dropped on the ground, just like grenades can. Everyone gets double the lightsticks!
 * A round is kept in the chamber when reloading all magazine-based weapons, except the Python. If you see your magazine going 1 above the maximum count, it isn't a bug, it's realism baby!

**Doors behave more realistically**
 * You can check the lock of a door without opening it by pressing the melee key.
 * Any shotgun can be used to breach any door.
 * A door may not be breached on the first shot of a shotgun. This depends on the material of the door. The M870 Breaching can breach any door in one shot.
 * When doors are breached with shotguns, they do not swing open like when breached with C2. You have to shoot the knob and then open the door.
 * Broken doors can now be closed and/or wedged.

**Commands can be issued using your voice. To enable this feature, tick 'Use Speech Recognition' in the Audio Options.**
 * See the SpeechCommands.md file for more information on how to issue orders using the Speech Command Interface.

**Commands are easier to give with a new Graphic Command Interface with lots of submenus instead of a single long list.**
 * You can now issue BREACH commands on unlocked doors.
 * You can now pick which style of BREACH you would like - either C2 & CLEAR or SHOTGUN & CLEAR
 * New CHECK FOR TRAPS command allows your AI companions to check doors for those all-important traps.
 * LEADER THROW commands: Now you can be the one to throw the grenade!
 * Lightsticks are broken into two commands: DROP LIGHTSTICK (where you order the nearest AI officer to drop a lightstick at their feet) and MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK (where you order an AI to drop a lightstick at what you're aiming at)
 * New RESTRAIN ALL, SECURE ALL, DISABLE ALL and SEARCH AND SECURE commands order officers to secure all targets near the player.

**Harsher penalties for tougher gameplay.**
 * Hostages and suspects that become incapacitated or killed now need to be reported to TOC, otherwise there is a penalty.
 * AI controlled officers can now trigger Unauthorized Use of Force when they use C2.
 * Snipers can now trigger Unauthorized Use of Force and Unauthorized Use of Deadly Force.
  * The game seems to take some wild liberties as to what qualifies as a passing mission. You could shoot all of the suspects illegally (in some cases without getting any penalty) on Food Wall on Hard and still beat it. You would be FIRED if you did this in real life.
  * A person being incapacitated is a big deal, and an ambulance would need to be ordered. Failing to disclose this could put their lives in jeopardy, so it makes sense for this to be a penalty. It did this for officers though (?) which I found odd.

**Important QOL (quality-of-life) and playability features that are essential to playing the game.**
 * There is an FOV slider and Mouse Smoothing disable checkbox. Also, widescreen resolutions are available in the menu and are (mostly) free of bugs.
 * Option to disable the initial dispatch briefings.
 * The game will tell you when you incur a penalty or complete an objective.
 * Wedges, grenades, lightsticks and C2 all show how many pieces you have left, while you have them equipped.
 * You can now assign loadout tabs (or whole loadouts) to one officer, a team, or the whole element.

**Overhauled Quick Mission Maker.**
 * All of the Quick Mission Maker scenarios are accessed from the Career menu instead of the Play Quick Mission menu. You need to create a new career for each one.
 * You can now use custom maps in the Quick Mission Maker.
 * You can now write your own briefings, as well as disable the civilians, suspects, and timeline tabs of the briefing.
 * You can now create a progression system, where missions are completed one-at-a-time.
 * You can now attach unlocks to each mission in a Quick Mission Maker pack.
 * You can now disable equipment in a Quick Mission Maker pack.
 * You can now rearrange the missions in a Quick Mission Maker pack. (Yes, this was something you couldn't do before...)

**Multiplayer improvements!**
 * Includes a fully-functional admin mod, with WebAdmin capabilities.
 * Snipers are now available in multiplayer.
 * New kinds of voting: Next Map, Start Map, and End Current Map. You can now choose to disable certain kinds of votes, instead of disabling all voting. There are other special options added regarding voting.
 * The chat now reports which room a person is when they send a chat message
 * You can enable or disable friendly fire in CO-OP.
 * You can now un-ready yourself in the pre-game lobby.

## HOW DO I INSTALL THE MOD?
Please read the How to Install section of this README. :)

## HOW DO I USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION?
First, you will need to ensure that your operating system supports Speech Recognition. What you'll need is the Microsoft Speech Recognition API, which Microsoft no longer provides. There is a public download of it available [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a3y68suledr90n5/MSSpeech_SR_en-US_TELE.msi?dl=0)
If your system meets the requirements, the 'Use Speech Recognition' checkbox will be available.
You can also bind a key to toggle the functionality ingame, which is good when you're speaking for a Let's Play, for example.
A list of trigger words is provided, starting with Patch 5.1. See SpeechCommands.md for more information.

**IF SPEECH RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK (CHECKBOX GREYED OUT):**

- What language is your operating system? *By default, the game will only work with an English (United States) version of Windows.*
In order to support more languages, you will need to edit your SEF/System/SpeechCommandGrammar.xml. Near the top of the file will be a line that reads like this:
```
<GRAMMAR LANGID="409">
```
You will want to modify this line so that it uses a number which corresponds to your operating system (NOT THE GAME!).
The list of languages can be found here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/hh361638
So for instance, if you have a Swedish operating system, you will want to change it so the line looks like this:
```
<GRAMMAR LANGID="41D">
```

- Did you install the API? (see the above link)

- Still not working? Try installing the Speech Recognition Improvement mod, and see if that mod works.


**IF SPEECH RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK (COMMAND NOT RECOGNIZED, OR MICROPHONE NOT WORKING)**

- Check to make sure that you did not disable the speech recognition with the keybind. (The key is not bound to anything by default)

- Check to make sure that the microphone works in Windows.

- Check to make sure that the microphone works in the game (try using the built-in VOIP feature and see if your friends can hear you in a multiplayer game)

- Make sure there is no background noise, like a television. The game may misinterpret it as being your voice.

- Make sure you are speaking clearly.
If you are using the language fix from the above, you will want to speak with a bad accent as much as possible. Really roll those Rs if you're using a Spanish OS.
If you aren't, try to talk like you're a newscaster or like you're having a conversation with someone on the phone and they aren't understanding you.
Also note that some things sound similar. For example, "Cuff her" sounds a lot like "cover".

- Make sure you are saying the correct thing.
See the SpeechCommands.md if you are having trouble saying a particular command.

## WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK" AND "DROP LIGHTSTICK"?
MARK WITH LIGHTSTICK orders the nearest officer to go to the location and drop a lightstick. DROP LIGHTSTICK orders the nearest officer to drop a lightstick at their feet.

## HOW CAN I CHECK FOR TRAPS IN MULTIPLAYER?
Use the Optiwand, and aim up at the doorknob.

## HOW CAN I PLAY IN MULTIPLAYER? ARE THERE ANY SERVERS?
Please read the How to Play in Multiplayer section of this README. :)

## HOW CAN I REPORT A BUG?
The best, and preferred method is to post it directly on our GitHub issues page: https://github.com/eezstreet/SWATEliteForce/issues
However, since doing so requires a GitHub account, it's not the most desirable option. You can also post on the Moddb page, which doesn't require an account.
Additionally, you can check us out on Discord, and chat with the developers: https://discord.gg/RfujTnF

## WHY CAN'T I PLAY IN BARRICADED SUSPECTS, VIP ESCORT, SMASH AND GRAB, OR RAPID DEPLOYMENT?
This mod uses very realistic values for the weapons, and ultimately it doesn't play well in PvP modes for those reasons.
Personally I would recommend playing these PvP modes on the original SWAT 4, non-TSS, since the PvP balance is as good as it can get.

## ARE YOU GOING TO ADD AI OFFICERS IN CAREER CO-OP?
Possibly.

## DOES THIS MOD WORK WITH OTHER MODS?
Please refer to the "Mod Compatibility" section of the README.

## I PLAYED IN SINGLEPLAYER, BUT THERE'S NO BRIEFINGS. WHY? ##
There are no briefings in an All Missions campaign. Play with either a SWAT 4 + TSS or Extra Missions campaign.
The reason there is no briefing is because the All Missions campaign pulls *all* missions from your hard drive, including custom maps.
These custom maps cannot have briefing or entry information added to them very easily. Loading up the briefing will cause a crash on those missions.

## I WANT TO CHANGE THE ENTRY IN ALL MISSIONS, BUT YOU REMOVED THE BRIEFING TAB? ##
The entry options are available on the Mission Selection screen, underneath the difficulty selection.

## I PLAYED IN SINGLEPLAYER, BUT THERE'S VERY FEW MISSIONS (1 OR 2). WHY?
You most likely selected the Extra Missions path when you started the career. There's three options: Extra Missions (missions added by the mod), SWAT 4 + TSS (the original game's missions), and All Missions (all missions from your hard drive, with no equipment progression).

## ARE THERE MORE MISSIONS FOR EXTRA MISSIONS COMING OUT?
Yes.

## I CAN'T FIND X PIECE OF EQUIPMENT! DID YOU REMOVE IT?
Only the ammo pouch was removed from the base game. If you cannot find a piece of equipment, make sure you have unlocked it in the campaign!
Note that some equipment (M16, Uzi, AKM, etc) is only available in multiplayer.

## BREACHING DOORS WITH THE SHOTGUN DOESN'T WORK!
Whether or not a shotgun breaches the door successfully is random and depends upon a few things:

 - The material of the door (wooden doors are easier to breach than metal ones)
 - The ammo type you are using (larger pellets = more likely to breach)
 - Which shotgun you are using (the M870 Breaching *always* breaches the door on the first shot)

Generally it takes about 2-3 shots on a wooden door and 3-4 shots on a metal door to breach it successfully.

## BEANBAGS DON'T WORK!
Beanbags can be negated by body armor. Try aiming for unarmored parts of the body.

## TRAPS AREN'T SHOWING UP! ##
...or another variation of this: "I played through the first mission, and the README says that there's supposed to be traps on it, but I never saw any traps!"
The traps are randomly generated on the mission. On almost every map that they can show up, it's possible for them to not show up at all.
On the Fairfax Residence mission, there's a 50% chance (100% on Elite) that a trap will spawn - and there's four total doors it can spawn on. 
So it's possible to trigger the trap almost immediately, but also possible to never encounter it, depending on the route you take and the randomization.

## HOW DO I DISARM A TRAP?
You can't disarm a trap if it's on the other side of a door. You can either blow it up (if it's electronic) with C2 or you can go around and remove it with the toolkit. Or just take the penalty.

## ARE YOU GOING TO ADD BALLISTIC SHIELDS?
Possibly, at some point. I would need someone to produce the art assets for it, as I'm not an artist.

## ARE YOU GOING TO ADD LEANING WHILE MOVING?
Moving and leaning requires hundreds of animations to be added to the game, due to the way the animation system in the game works. Unless someone can come forward and make all of those animations for me, then no.

## DISABLING IRONSIGHTS ZOOM IS NOT WORKING!
If you are ingame and you check "Disable Ironsights Zoom" then it won't work until you change your weapon, because of how the code works. Just change to a different piece of equipment and change back.

## WHAT HAPPENED TO INSTANT ACTION? ##
Instant Action was removed because nobody used it. Furthermore, it causes issues with Permadeath campaigns, among other things.

## THE PLAY QUICK MISSION BUTTON WAS REMOVED ON THE MAIN MENU. HOW DO I PLAY THEM? ##
You now need to create a career for them, in the Career menu. This is because Quick Missions support a ton of new features, like progression, unlocks, etc. They also work with Permadeath modes.

## I CANNOT PROGRESS IN THE CAMPAIGN! ##
This is a common bug that is encountered. Sometimes you will play a mission, even scoring a 100/100 on it, and the next mission won't unlock. Sometimes even if you replay it over and over again, even on Easy, it won't progress. This seems to happen a lot on the first mission for some reason.
I have no idea why this happens, or what the explanation is for it. It has happened to me and others in the vanilla game, both with and without the expansion.
To solve it, you can just unlock the next mission and the campaign will progress normally after this.

To unlock the next mission, find your SEF/System/Campaign.ini file. (Sometimes it is not here, it is ContentExpansion/System/Campaign.ini)
Edit this file in Notepad, and find your career in here. It should be fairly obvious, and look something like this:
```ini
[Campaign_Officer_Default]
StringName=Officer Default
CampaignPath=0
availableIndex=0
HACK_HasPlayedCreditsOnCampaignCompletion=False
```
All you need to do here is take the line that reads `availableIndex=<SOME NUMBER>` and increase that number by 1.
So for example, if I am stuck on the first level, I need to increase that 0 to a 1.
You can increase this all the way to 20 and unlock all of the missions, if you feel like cheating.

# KNOWN ISSUES #

Please read the FAQ before looking here! It's entirely possible that what you are seeing is intentional behavior.
  * Officers sometimes ignore orders, you might have to issue a command two or three times. Problem of the original game.
  * Officers sometimes ignore orders and say something like "I'm busy." This is a problem of the original game; they sometimes can see suspects where the player can't.
  * Sometimes when you are loading up the game, you can get no sound at all. This is an issue introduced by the Stetchkov Syndicate expansion pack. Sometimes it can be solved by simply restarting the game and not running the game in windowed mode. Sometimes, if you have two detected audio devices (one for output, and one for both input and output), make sure that the one that is responsible for both input and output is DISABLED. The game is bugged and will sometimes pick the wrong audio device.
  * "gui_tex package version mismatch" when joining a server: Make sure you are running under International language. Sometimes it defaults itself to English or some other language. Search for `Language=eng` or `Language=grm` in SEF/System/Swat4x.ini and make sure it's set to `Language=int`


# OTHER MINOR CHANGES #

## TSS BUGS FIXED ##
 * Typos, wrong captions, etc fixed throughout.
 * AI-Controlled Officers will fire their weapons/non lethal equipment much more smartly and won't kill hostages or waste taser/pepper spray ammo needlessly.
 * AI-Controlled Officers wouldn't fire their weapon if the suspect was very close.
 * AI-Controlled Officers wouldn't give a verbal response to the COVER command.
 * AI-Controlled Officers, when ordered to breach a room with a breaching shotgun, would shoot the lock, there would be a pause, and the lock would appear broken. The pause is removed.
 * It was possible to access equipment in singleplayer when it wasn't unlocked by creating a custom loadout; it will now tell you that the equipment is not unlocked when doing so.
 * "Press ESC and debrief to exit the game" now shows on ALL missions, not just Food Wall, Fairfax Residence and Qwik Fuel missions.

 * Night vision goggles no longer alert AI to your presence
 * Explosion effects from gas cans DO alert AI to your presence now
 * Office workers on Department of Agriculture and terrorists from Mt. Threshold Research Center had stupidly high max morale.
 * Suspects weren't taking into account whether a door was locked or wedged when fleeing, which would lead to cases where they would try to open the door in an endless loop while running away.
 * Arresting people with No Armor equipped was glitchy
 * The Multiplayer ESC menu didn't show colors on the server name.
 * Taser recoil applied to every player on the map, not just the person who shot it.
 * Lightstick-related commands weren't greyed out if there weren't any officers with lightsticks
 * Weapons couldn't be picked up while aiming through incapacitated/dead suspects/civilians
 * Lightsticks couldn't be dropped if the officer was wearing heavy armor (they would appear at the world origin)
 * Server browser showed duplicate servers
 * Server browser player sorting didn't work correctly
 * Ordering your team to disable something while they were restraining people (or collecting evidence) would cause them to stop restraining targets (or collecting evidence), and vice versa.

 * The enemy "AnnouncedSpottedOfficerSurprised" speech now plays.
 * Applying a loadout to the whole team in a Quick Mission which has locked equipment allowed the player to bypass the locked equipment entirely.

 * The gunshot sound effects on Northside Vending and Amusements from the laundromat would not play correctly on the expansion (but would in the vanilla game).
 * The gunshot sound effects on A-Bomb Nightclub from the stage would not play correctly on the expansion (but would in the vanilla game).
 * On Fresnal St. Station, hostages that spawned on the train platform would scream endlessly after a suspect escaped.
 * On Fresnal St. Station, there is a mirror point that can have orders issued to it, but it is inaccessible.
 * FunTime Amusements was missing loading screen text.
 * The accomplice on Fairfax Residence could spawn with two Colt Pythons.
 * The Host Game and Server Setup menus did not display color codes properly on the map list, map name, and map author.

 * Highground audio on Food Wall was wrong ("He went back into the house", this was meant for Fairfax Residence)
 * Highground audio on Fairfax Residence was wrong ("Side 3 Level 2")

 * Re-enabled Auto Downloads feature.
 * The player could control the officer viewport while reloading, switching weapons, or using an item. This allowed for an exploit where players could move while placing C2, arresting people, or picking a lock.
 * Players could not melee with handcuffs after pressing zoom (despite zoom doing nothing)
 * Players on the red team using the default skin looked like suspects

## AI ##
  * Tons and tons of cut dialogue restored.
  * Lots of minor little animation glitches on SWAT officers fixed.
  * In general: SWAT AI is both smarter and better stat-wise. Suspects are statistically worse, but make up for this in intelligence and cunning strategies.
  * Suspects no longer have an instant lock-on aim. Rather, there is a small delay between when they spot you and when they will fire.
  * Likewise, suspects do not always fire with perfect accuracy. Sometimes, low skill gang members can fire their gun sideways (a cut animation) for even worse accuracy.
  * Suspects will escape after giving up (even if there is no gun present -- if there is one, they will pick it up and attack), but not when watched, and will try to barricade themselves in a room.
  * Suspects can hear gunshots from across the map (unless they are silenced) and can choose to investigate or barricade their position randomly.
  * Suspects may take on a variety of personalities, such as Insane and Polite. Insane suspects shoot hostages with little restraint, while Polite ones do not shoot at all at them.
  * Suspects and civilians may randomly wander around on a few maps, instead of using fixed patrols.
  * Suspects will close doors after firing at them.
  * Suspects may shoot the player when running away from them.
  * Suspects can shoot through thin pieces of cover, if their weapon (and ammo) is capable of it.
  * Suspects may choose to shoot through their accomplices, if they are low skilled or Insane.
  * Suspects can wear heavy armor like SWAT can.
  * Suspects drop their weapons much faster. Most of the time.
  * Suspects react faster to grenades.
  * Suspects fire upon hostages twice as quickly.
  * Suspects will choose to fire either in full auto or in burst, depending on their skill level.
  * Suspects firing from cover may choose to pause or regroup between their shots, instead of constantly aiming at their target.
  * Civilians may be Fearless. When they are Fearless, they do not scream when in the presence of a suspect.
  * SWAT are much more dangerous and less hesitant to shoot at suspects.
  * SWAT do not form "death funnels" in doors and instead will try to continue moving.
  * SWAT will attempt to seek out cover when engaging suspects (only after clearing a room or when issued a COVER command)
  * SWAT can properly use the grenade launcher now.
  * SWAT AI will ignore uncompliant civilians or cuffed civilians/suspects while there are active threats.
  * SWAT will no longer try to shoot through civilians or players when attacking their target.
  * SWAT will reload their weapons when ordered to fall in.
  * SWAT do not become distracted by suspects/civilians when they are following you or going to a specific destination (with MOVE TO). They will shout at them (and/or attack), but continue moving.
  * SWAT will shoot beanbags and pepperballs at fleeing suspects (when following a FALL IN or MOVE TO command) intelligently, keeping in mind not to spam beanbags and kill people. SWAT can now use pepperballs and beanbags as proper weapons in general.
  * SWAT will listen to and respond to sounds even when they have an enemy, so they have better situational awareness.
  * SWAT clears rooms quicker and drops a lightstick after clearing.
  * SWAT now turns at the same rate that suspects do (which is faster) and have higher field of vision.
  * SWAT no longer moves out of the way if they are deploying a wedge and they are bumped by the door. Note, if they are moving into position to deploy the wedge, they will still get out of the way.

## GAMEPLAY ##
  * Maps may now alter themselves based on difficulty level, for instance adding more suspects or traps in Elite difficulty. Only a few maps use this feature currently.
  * Doors can randomly be locked or opened.
  * You can now lock doors using the toolkit. Suspects cannot flee as easily through locked doors (they need to unlock them first)
  * The toolkit interface no longer shows up for doors that cannot be locked
  * Tasing your fellow officer and tripping traps now incurs a penalty
  * Tweaked limb damage slightly. JHP does more "expansion" damage to account for drag.
  * Incapacitation occurs at 30 health instead of 20.
  * Using your Shout button on a restrained suspect will taunt them. Examples include "You have the right to remain silent," etc. Doesn't do anything, it's just an easter egg. Warning: The suspect may have some unkind words for you in return.
  * Likewise, this works on restrained civilians as well. "It'll be okay," etc.
  * Suspects now have a slight delay when firing upon the player.
  * (Non-Insane/Non-Polite) suspects take twice as long before shooting hostages
  * Added a new quality: Polite. Any suspect archetype with this quality won't attempt to shoot hostages.
  * Added a new quality: Insane. Any suspect archetype with this quality will shoot hostages *much* faster (basically instantly) and ignores distance checks.
  * Grenades and wedges now go back to your last used weapon after using one, instead of switching back to that item.
  * Custom player skins can now override the first person hands texture.

  * Maps in the Voting screen are now sorted alphabetically.
  * Host Game no longer precaches all of the maps at once; it goes to the menu and loads the maps while in the menu.
  * Added Advanced Information tab to Equipment Panel. It now shows a weapon's manufacturer, manufacturer country, date manufactured, caliber, magazine size, maximum ammo carried, muzzle velocity and firing modes. It also shows advanced information for protective equipment.
  * Weapons are now selected by dropdown menus, for faster selection
  * New splash screen
  * More advanced console. It will now show output of commands, and a console log. You need to press ESC to close the console now.

# HOW TO PLAY IN MULTIPLAYER #

## Using GameRanger (preferred) ##
BOTH PLAYERS will need to do the following:
Download and install GameRanger. It can be found at http://gameranger.com
Next, GameRanger will automatically detect SWAT 4 and SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate, if all is OK.
You may need to manually detect these, if GameRanger doesn't do it for you.
You will need to rename the LaunchSEF.exe in SEF/Extras to SWAT4X.exe so Gameranger will recognize it. (It's named LaunchSEF.exe so that it isn't automatically detected!)
Then, you will need to modify the Stetchkov Syndicate game in Gameranger so it points to the Swat4X.exe file in SEF/Extras/Swat4X.exe.

THE HOST will need to do the following:
Create a game room, as a SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate game. (TIP: if this is going to be a publicly joinable game, be sure to mention it's using the SEF mod and specify the version!)
When enough players have joined, press the Start Game button. This will launch the game. From here, go to the Host Game menu and start up a server.
Important Note: Do not launch as a dedicated server while using GameRanger.
The other players will automatically connect to your game while you are loading the map.

THE CLIENT will need to do the following:
Join a public game, or your friend's game. That's all you really need to do.

### TROUBLESHOOTING ###
**NOTE: If you have the mod installed incorrectly, LaunchSEF.exe won't work!**

Make sure you have the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Redistributable. It is required to run LaunchSEF.exe and other applications. Download it here:

* **64-bit Windows:** https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746572
* **32-bit Windows:** https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746571

If GameRanger "aborts" when it launches, you may have some application (antivirus?) interfering with LaunchSEF.exe. If this happens, copy all .exe and .dll files from `ContentExpansion/System` into `SEF/System` and point GameRanger to the Swat4X.exe that is in `SEF/System`. This is kind of an ultra last resort option however!

## Traditional Method (TCP/IP) ##
SWAT: Elite Force v4 was the first version of this mod to allow for multiplayer play. v5 introduced Campaign CO-OP and allowed for publishing of games to Swat4Stats without a CD-key (removing DRM that GOG didn't).

### If you want to join a game: ###

If the game you want is not hosted via LAN, then you will need the SWAT4Stats server browser plugin. It's available at http://swat4stats.com - make sure you get the TSS version.

After it is installed, your server list will show all of the servers, including the ones that are on different mods. Just join the one you want. There are a number of 24/7 SEF servers out there.

If the game you want is hosted via LAN, or you cannot find the server in the list, you will need the host's external IP address (have the host look this up on http://myexternalip.com). You can then join the game from the Join Game menu using the IP address.

### If you want to host a game ###

First, you will need to open some ports on your router: 10480 - 10483, TCP/UDP. If you aren't sure how to do this, the following article explains it well: https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/

**OPTIONAL:** If you want your game to be publicly visible on the master server list (on swat4stats), you will need to install the Swat4Stats server browser plugin, available at http://swat4stats.com - You'll also want to set your game to be "Internet" and not "LAN" for this to work.

If you aren't playing an Internet/Swat4Stats enabled game, you will need your external IP address for other players to connect. You can look this up on http://myexternalip.com
Lastly, you need to determine what type of game you want to play. Regular CO-OP is handled through the Host Game menu ingame, but Campaign CO-OP is done through the Career menu - select a campaign and hit Career CO-OP. The "Equipment" panel will change to a "Settings" panel where you can configure a password, etc just like in Host Game.

Once you have selected your map settings and have started the server at least once, you can quickly launch a server (without going ingame) by using the Dedicated Server.bat file. You can then join the server from the Join Server menu.

## Admin System ##
Server hosts should NOT use MarkMod, SES Mod, Gez Mod, or Snitch for admin features. Those mods can introduce glitches, bugs, or crashes or break some of the features of SWAT: Elite Force. Instead, SEF includes its own admin mod which aims to combine a lot of the best features of those mods. If you are pining for a particular feature of one of those, let me know and I will work on adding it!

Administrator permissions are doled out through the use of "roles." Everyone by default is assigned to the Guest role; it is not recommended that you give the Guest role very many powers, if any at all. A player can only have one role at a time. Each role should have a unique password associated with it. To log in to a role, click on the "Admin Login" button and enter the password associated with the desired role.

Admin Roles should be assigned through the Host Game menu, when setting up the server settings.

Additionally, SEF also has an MOTD system. The only way (currently) to configure this is through the use of editing INI files. Open SEF/System/Swat4XDedicatedServer.ini. In the section titled `[SwatGame.SwatAdmin]` (at the bottom), add your MOTD lines by the following:

```ini
AutoActions=(Delay=NumSeconds,ExecuteText="Command")
```

Replace `NumSeconds` with the number of seconds (decimal number) before the command will be executed, and `"Command"` with the command text. The command text can be "print " followed by a message to print a string to chat, or "ac " followed by an admin command to execute that command.

As a trivial example, this will print three lines of text every 10 minutes:

```ini
AutoActions=(Delay=600.0,ExecuteText="[c=FFFFFF]Welcome to my server![\\c]")
AutoActions=(Delay=0.5,ExecuteText="[c=FFFFFF]I hope you have fun![\\c]]")
AutoActions=(Delay=0.5,ExecuteText="[c=FFFFFF]Please be nice to others![\\c]")
```

WebAdmin defaults to port 6000. You can access it in a web browser by going to: http://<external ip>:6000/
On the host machine, this can be reached from http://127.0.0.1:6000/

For some tools, you might want to get JSON metadata off of the server. There are two specialized addresses to pull data from. You can see an example of how the data is formatted by going to the listed addresses in your browser.
Note that all enumerations start from zero. They are updated as of v7.

 * Player data can be pulled from `<webadmin address>/json/players`. The Status field can be one of the following from this enumeration:

```cpp
enum COOPStatus
{
    STATUS_NotReady,
    STATUS_Ready,
    STATUS_Healthy,
    STATUS_Injured,
    STATUS_Incapacitated,
};
```

 * A full readout of the server's webadmin logs can be pulled from `<webadmin address>/json/log`. The Message Type field can be one of the following from this enumeration:

```cpp
enum WebAdminMessageType
{
	MessageType_Chat,
	MessageType_PlayerJoin,
	MessageType_AdminJoin,
	MessageType_AdminLeave,
	MessageType_Penalty,
	MessageType_SwitchTeams,
	MessageType_NameChange,
	MessageType_Voting,
	MessageType_Kill,
	MessageType_TeamKill,
	MessageType_Arrest,
	MessageType_Round,
	MessageType_WebAdminError,
};
```

Note that `MessageType_SwitchTeams` is also used for administrator actions, and messages sent by AutoActions are *not* included as part of these logs.
As a security precaution, note that *anyone* can access these URLs and get a message log. So you should probably not be discussing sensitive information on the server.
