 - Fixed TSS bug: Grenade launchers would do maximum damage at all times, even when fired across long distances, as long as it didn't bounce. It uses new mechanics now to determine the damage.
 - Fixed TSS bug: You can now swap between sniper viewports after a sniper has reported a contact (If "Press Page Up to view sniper viewport" appears), instead of there being a cooldown.

Whenever you stun a target with a less-lethal piece of equipment (taser, pepper spray, beanbags, stinger grenades, punching, ... but not CS gas, flashbangs or pepperball gun), there is a chance that nearby civilians will feel the same morale modification. This will make it much less tedious to pepper spray all civilians in a room on maps like Mt. Threshold Research Center or A-Bomb Nightclub, where there are many uncompliant civilians.
 - Bulk now affects your weapon switching and reloading speed. Having less bulk means that you will reload your weapons faster and switch between equipment faster.
 - Added a new button, 'Pick Random Map', to the All Missions mission selection screen. Clicking the button will pick a random map to play. (You can click it over and over again until you find a map that you would like.)
 - Added a Map Filter combobox to the Host Game menu. You can filter maps in the list by their source (All Maps, Custom Maps or Stock Maps)
 - When hosting a game, you can now enable/disable the timer at the beginning or end of a map.
 - Redid the lighting on Brewer County Courthouse
 - A LOT of cut speech was restored, including: "arrested" lines by the player and AI officers, lines when the player goes rogue, AI responses to commands, AI responses to dead suspects, civilian lines when shot at, and a lot of the FunTime drug dealer lines
 - Named speakers from the TSS missions will now be labeled as such in their subtitles. For example, Andrew Norman will appear as "Andrew Norman" instead of "Male Suspect" (*). Band Members from Sellers Street Auditorium are labeled as such, and aren't "Male Civilian"
 - More blood will appear when shooting something
 - Suspects are now considered threats when they move towards a hostage for the purpose of threatening them.
 - Reduced suspect and civilian field of view (120 -> 80)
 - Increased officer field of view (120 -> 180)
 - Officers now turn faster, at the same speed suspects do.
 - Officers will no longer report that they are busy when issued an order.
 - Officers react faster to suspects.
 - Officers will no longer take cover if they are very close to a suspect
 - Officers use the same take-cover time as highly-skilled suspects do
 - Officers will clear rooms quicker
 - Officers will listen to (and respond to) sounds even when they have a current enemy
 - Suspects drop their weapons when cowering
 - Suspects are no longer a threat when cowering

 - Added a little blurb of text on the Campaign menu to better explain what each career path does
 - Fixed P90 flashlight
 - Fixed M4Super90 iron sights position
 - Fixed ambient sounds and scripted conversations on Meat Barn Restaurant
 - Fixed multiplayer spawn points on Brewer County Courthouse
 - Fixed SEF bug: Wild Gunner delay not working (fixed for real this time)
 - Fixed SEF bug: Breaching ammo would never breach the door. (It now has a 50% chance to breach a metal door, and 75% chance to breach a wooden door, unless a Breaching Shotgun is used)
 - Fixed SEF bug: Some Sovereign Citizen lines did not play correctly
 - Fixed SEF bug: Magazine count display on equipment panels only showed 2 digits (so pepperball only displayed as "20")
 - Fixed SEF bug: A suspect or civilian who was cuffed and then reported, then incapacitated or killed, would count as "failed to report downed suspect" even though they were already reported.
 - Fixed SEF bug: Using the "say" command in the dedicated server or MarkMods WebAdmin panel would crash the server
 - Fixed SEF bug: Deleting a campaign wouldn't wipe its stats or permadeath status, so creating another one of the same name would result in bugs
 - Fixed SEF bug: M4A1 Suppressed in third person had a glowing silencer
 - Fixed SEF bug: HK33 had wrong model in third person
 - Fixed SEF bug: MP5SSD6 had fingers covering the iron sights
 - Fixed SEF bug: Creating a QMM with no civilians lead to a maximum score of 90/100 due to a bug in the way All Civilians Unharmed score was calculated
 - Fixed TSS bug: Spoken lines by TOC on TSS missions would cut off if the player used the shout button
 - Fixed TSS bug: Some incorrect subtitles
 - Fixed TSS bug: Using the Bulgarian Drug Worker as a suspect in QMM will no longer cause sound bugs


### v6 ###

#### MAJOR FEATURES ####

- First person improvements!
  * By hitting the zoom key, you will transition into (fully 3D) Iron Sights! While in Iron Sights, you suffer less recoil and firing your weapon affects your accuracy less. The visual representation of iron sights can be disabled in favor of the old behavior in the Game Options menu, if you prefer.
  * Lightsticks are thrown like grenades now. Chuck them across the room, or just drop them at your feet!
  * Tactical equipment (grenades, lightsticks, C2, pepper spray, wedges) now show how many you have in reserve on the HUD.
- Equipment changes!
  * The breaching tab has been removed and a sixth tactical slot has been added.
  * C2 is now considered a tactical piece of equipment, and the breaching shotgun is a weapon. The breaching shotgun will breach a door 100% of the time, unlike other shotguns where this chance is random.
  * New silenced versions of base game weapons: Suppressed M4A1, Suppressed UMP and Suppressed G36C. More weight and bulk, but won't tip off suspects in adjacent rooms when fired.
  * Added a cut weapon from the game: The M1Super90.
  * 3-packs of Wedges, Flashbangs, CS Gas and Stingers have been added. They have 3 tactical items, with the equivalent weight and bulk of five of those items.
  * All shotguns now have Frangible Breaching Ammo, which doesn't ricochet or overpenetrate a door.
  * The gas mask is now called the Respirator and no longer restricts field of view. A new gas mask, the S10 Helmet, has been added!
- Command interface overhaul!
  * New commands: SEARCH AND SECURE, SECURE ALL, RESTRAIN ALL, and DISABLE ALL.
     * SECURE ALL, RESTRAIN ALL, and DISABLE ALL will secure all evidence, restrain all compliant hostages/suspects, or disable all devices in a radius around the player, OR everything in the same room (whichever is farther, if the mission is NOT complete). SEARCH AND SECURE combines all three of these commands.
  * The lightstick commands got moved back to the DEPLOY submenu, and all of the DEPLOY commands were reorganized based on how frequently they are used.
  * The Classic Command Interface (CCI) has had all of its commands reorganized to play better.
- More AI improvements!
  * High skilled suspects are much more dangerous.
  * Enemies have figured out how to equip heavy armor! Your AP rounds will be very important.
- Menu improvements!
  * You can now apply a single tab (or a whole loadout) to another officer, another team, or element. It's much easier now to keep a consistent loadout amongst your men.
  * You can now select which entrance to use in an All Missions campaign.
  * You can now vote (in multiplayer) to end the current map, or to go to the next map. You can also vote in Career CO-OP mode.
  * The Join Game menu now won't show duplicate servers, the player sorting is better, and there is a link to download the server browser plugin.
  * The main menu now has a link to Discord and the Wiki and shows the mod version.

- Cut content restored: Blood spray texture that was not used [kf]
- Fixed SEF bug: Sniper rifle not firing in multiplayer
- Fixed SEF bug: Sniper rifle viewport not controllable on listen servers

### v5.2 ###
- Fixed a very frequent crash in multiplayer that was introduced in 5.1
- Corrected glitches in the grenade animations which appeared at high FOVs
- Tweaked the speed of the surrender animation so it plays slower (thanks to kevinfoley for this change)


### v5.1 ###

#### MAIN CHANGES
- Some additional improvements to speech commands (thanks to kevinfoley for these changes):
  * You can now report things to TOC using your voice!
  * Improved the speech commands with CS gas
  * A new SpeechCommands.md file has been provided which lists all the things you can say to trigger voice commands.
- Adjusted the weapon accuracies (see Weapon Changes for more information)
- Reduced the drag of beanbag ammo by 25% so it can hit more distant targets
- AI will now wait before entering a room after a gas grenade goes off. The amount of time depends on what equipment your officers have equipped. (thanks to kevinfoley for this change)
- Halved the melee range (170 -> 85)
- Reduced the damage done by torso shots against all targets
- Increased the damage done by 9mm AP and .223 ammunition
- Suspects have a chance to drop their weapon immediately upon surrendering, making it less likely to shoot them accidentally
- Added a "grace period" to compliance. If a suspect becomes compliant and you accidentally shoot them within a moment of their surrender, no penalty is ensued.
- Restored cut dialogue: Officers will report when they've lost sight of a suspect.
- Fixed SEF bug: Investigating enemies were considered threats (for the purposes of penalties and officer AI)
- Fixed SEF bug: Fleeing suspects who were attacking were *not* considered threats (for the purposes of penalties and officer AI)

- Fixed SEF bug: Manager on Meat Barn had a ridiculously high amount of morale (3.0)
- Fixed TSS/SEF bug: Suspects could be "juked" by running in a circle around them and/or spamming crouch, which would foil their AI and prevent them from firing. This was more pronounced in SEF since enemies take longer to fire their weapon.
- Fixed TSS bug: Punching a restrained suspect would make them stand up.
- Fixed TSS bug: Punching while changing weapons (or when finishing an arrest) would cause weird bugs, including turning your weapon invisible and going into a T-pose
- Fixed TSS bug: Compliant/arrested "Wild Gunner" AIs (the kind with M249 SAWs) would be sweeping back and forth still, which looked odd (they still do this while they are stunned, but it'll require some reorganization of the code to fix this properly)

### v5 ###

### v4.1 ###
This is a hotfix patch to address some common issues that have been raised.
- The taunt feature has been improved significantly. You now have to be aiming at the target in order to taunt at them.
- The FOV slider no longer freezes the game, and resolution options should now save correctly. (Review the updated installation instructions if it does not work.) Navigating away from the Video Options menu will bring up a "Please Wait..." dialogue as it saves settings.
- Widescreen improvements; the GUI has been tweaked so that certain widescreen resolutions (mostly 16:9 ones) won't have disappearing elements in the GUI. Ultrawide is still unsupported at the moment and there might be a few issues I missed.
- Sellers St. Auditorium no longer displays the Colt Carbine text for New Equipment; it displays the UMP text correctly instead.
- Fixed an issue that caused magazine counts to "reset" themselves when switching away from a shotgun
- Speech Command Interface improvements:
  * Now distinguishes between "Mark with Lightstick" and "Drop Lightstick" properly
  * Added missing commands: SECURE EVIDENCE, RESTRAIN and all of the LEADER THROW commands.
  * Added a new keybind to the Key Config menu: Toggle Speech Commands. This button turns off/on the speech command interface; which is good for streamers.
  * You can now shout for compliance at civilians, suspects, etc using your voice. Try "Police!", "Put your hands up!", "Drop your weapons!" or for roleplay purposes, "Police! Search warrant!"
  * Commands involving "stinger" now use "sting" since this was often confused by the engine for "taser"

### v4 ###

#### MAJOR FEATURES ####
- Introducing, Extra Missions! These are a second, Irrational-quality campaign of missions for you to explore.
  * You will need to create a second campaign (in the menu) and select Extra Missions from the dropdown box (SWAT4 + TSS are selected by default)
  * The first one, Meat Barn Restaurant, is an altered version of the multiplayer-exclusive Meat Barn Restaurant. Major changes were made to the layout to make it easier in Singleplayer and CO-OP.
- New system: Weight/Bulk. Instead of speed and use time being dictated by armor equipped, it's now based on two variables: Weight and Bulk.
  * There are two bars on the loadout screen to help visualize how much weight/bulk you have, along with the real values.
  * WEIGHT will slow you down. It is measured in kilograms, as a measure of how heavy things are.
  * BULK will make things take longer to use. It is a percentage ingame, with real measurements behind it - it is a measure of surface area of your gear.
  * Generally weight and bulk go in tandem, but there are some differences. The Desert Eagle is heavier than the Python, but the Python is more bulky.
- Weapons have been totally altered, both internally (how they function) and externally (how they play).
  * All weapons have reworked accuracy, recoil and handling characteristics using realistic weights and lenght for each. Light, shorter weapons like pistols and SMGs now suffer less penalties for movement and injuries, whereas long, heavier weapons like assault rifles and shotguns are more accurate and powerful.
  * The ammo bag tactical aid has been removed. Instead you can now customize the amount of ammo you want to bring, to fine-tune your weight and bulk.
  * Weapons have been given more realistic rates of fire and muzzle velocities. In terms of gameplay, higher muzzle velocity = more potential for penetration. Most weapons got reduced muzzle velocity, except for the P90, TEC-9 and UMP.
  * Bullets can now ricochet off of hard surfaces, such as concrete, stone, bricks, etc. Ricochets occur from FMJ and buckshot rounds. (This feature will be improved as more research is done)
  * All secondary weapons are available in primary weapon slots.
  * Heavy Armor now acts differently. It completely protects against conventional weapons, but may become damaged over time. At 0% health, it will only be as effective as Light Armor.
  * The Less Lethal shotgun is much more dangerous. Don't fire it at point blank range; give the beanbags some travel time, and don't aim for the head...
- New set of commands in singleplayer: LEADER THROW. These commands allow you to use a grenade instead of your AI companions.
  * For hold commands, when the INITIATE command is done, officers will blow/open the door, and will only enter after you use a grenade. Therefore, you only need one grenade for a double entry.
  * These commands work for both thrown grenades and the grenade launcher, and they're "one-command-fits all" (OPEN, LEADER & CLEAR accepts flashbangs, CS gas and sting grenades without needing to pick in the menu)
- Many changes to both the officer and suspect AI to make them both better.
- The console has been improved.
- Completely redid all of the campaign progression/unlocks.
- You can now lock doors using the toolkit.

#### MINOR FEATURES / FULL CHANGES ####
- Added Meat Barn Restaurant extra mission
- Fixed CO-OP and tested. It works now, honest! Although it will see some improvements.
- AI improvements: SWAT officers no longer stare down noncompliant civilians for days
- AI improvements: SWAT officers will no longer form "death funnels" as easily in doors - they will engage with suspects while moving through doors.
- AI improvements: Suspects are more likely to play a Get-Hit animation when they are injured and are less accurate in general
- AI improvements: Suspects will no longer shoot instantaneously at SWAT officers. There is a small delay, dependent on skill level.
- AI improvements: Suspects will now shoot at SWAT officers while on the move. The chance is dependent on the skill level of the suspect.
- Fixed TSS bug/AI Improvements: Known locked/wedged doors weren't being taken into account when a suspect evaluates if it should flee.
- Fixed TSS bug: Can save loadouts to work around the campaign unlocks (It will bring up a dialog box informing you that the loadout you want uses invalid equipment)
- Fixed TSS bug: Glitchy arrests with No Armor
- Fixed TSS bug: Optiwand glitchy in multiplayer when near doors (unverified)
- Fixed TSS bug: Pregame not showing HTML styling of server name
- Fixed TSS bug: Glock not selectable in Custom Mission Maker
- Fixed TSS bug: Taser recoil applying to every player on the map
- Fixed TSS bug: Server name field in Multiplayer Setup not matching the actual number of characters that could be used
- Fixed TSS bug: When using Deploy C2 command, AI will pick the lock if they are out of C2
- Fixed TSS bug: TEC-9 not having any reload sound effects
- Fixed TSS bug: Hologen suspects having ridiculously high morale at times
- Fixed SEF bug: Join Game button on menu not appearing
- Fixed SEF bug: Officers picking locks on unlocked doors when ordered to breach and out of C2
- Fixed SEF bug: Riot Helmet not protecting against pepper spray like it's supposed to.
- Fixed SEF bug: Sniper rifle not accurate
- Fixed SEF bug: Wrong resolution in options menu (1600x1050 -> 1680x1050)
- Fixed SEF bug: Wrong window title ("MyMod" -> "SWAT: Elite Force")
- Fixed SEF bug: Invisible traps in CO-OP
- Fixed SEF bug: Invisible drug bags in CO-OP
- Five new commands: LEADER THROW & CLEAR; OPEN, LEADER & CLEAR; OPEN, LEADER & MAKE ENTRY; BREACH, LEADER & CLEAR; BREACH, LEADER & MAKE ENTRY. These commands let you throw the grenade instead of the AI doing it.
- Equipment is now affected by Weight and Bulk. Weight, which represents how heavy your equipment is, slows your character down, and Bulk, which represents how large your equipment is, slows down your actions.
- The toolkit can now be used to lock doors.
- Added an FOV slider (Video Options) and a Mouse Smoothing checkbox (Controls Settings)
- The toolkit interface no longer shows up for doors that cannot be locked (e.g, all of the doors on St. Micheal's Medical Center)
- FMJ and buckshot can now ricochet off of hard surfaces
- Bullets are now affected by drag; they will lose momentum (and therefore lethality) over long distances. JHP is more susceptible to drag than FMJ rounds.
- Heavy Armor now has "health". It will protect against rifle rounds almost perfectly but will lose that ability with successive shots.
- JHP does slightly more bullet-expansion ("internal damage") damage to account for drag.
- Restored cut content: AI-controlled officers will now report when they spot a civilian
- Restored cut content: Suspects will now yell loudly as they shoot at doors
- Redid all of the campaign progression/unlocks
- Added "Take Screenshot" option to controls menu
- Minor changes to the compliance system (see the detailed section below for a full list of changes)
- Civilians are now not ridiculously noncompliant like they were before
- Incapacitation health increased from 20 to 30, so incapacitation is more likely
- All pistols are selectable in primary weapon slots.
- CO-OP damage modifier reduced (2.0x -> 1.5x, same as Elite difficulty) and Easy damage modifier increased (0.5x -> 1.0x, same as Normal difficulty)
- Ammo Bandolier item removed
- VIP Colt M1911 removed
- Officers get (by default) 3 primary magazines and 5 secondary magazines. The only exception is Jackson, who gets 25 shotgun shells.
- You can no longer edit your equipment in Multiplayer while you are ready. Unready yourself first.
- You can no longer ready in Multiplayer while your equipment is over weight or bulk.
- If your equipment is over weight in multiplayer, it will be replaced with the default loadout.
- Mapmakers now have the ability for Rosters (bombs/enemies/hostages/etc) to be based on difficulty level.
- The scoring system has been changed. There is no longer a bonus for no suspects incapacitated or killed. Elite difficulty now requires 90 instead of 95 score to complete.
- Moved a few strings from SwatProcedures.ini to SwatProcedures.int so they can be localized correctly
- The Host Game menu no longer loads all of the maps in one go. Instead, the menu will load quickly, and parse all of the maps while in the menu. It will stutter for a bit while it loads all the maps; this is normal.
- The Host Game menu now STRICTLY enforces CO-OP mode. Lots of options relating to Barricaded Suspects/VIP Escort/Smash and Grab have been removed.
- Console upgrades: The console will no longer close after entering a command (use the ESC key)
- Console upgrades: The console will show a log of commands used and show the output of commands
- Console upgrades: New console command "history"

## COMPLIANCE CHANGES ##
