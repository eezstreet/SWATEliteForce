//=============================================================================
/// UnrealScript Commandlet (command-line applet) class.
///
/// Commandlets are executed from the ucc.exe command line utility, using the
/// following syntax:
///
///     UCC.exe package_name.commandlet_class_name [parm=value]...
///
/// for example:
///
///     UCC.exe Core.HelloWorldCommandlet
///     UCC.exe Editor.MakeCommandlet
///
/// In addition, if you list your commandlet in the public section of your
/// package's .int file (see Engine.int for example), then your commandlet
/// can be executed without requiring a fully qualified name, for example:
///
///     UCC.exe MakeCommandlet
///
/// As a convenience, if a user tries to run a commandlet and the exact
/// name he types isn't found, then ucc.exe appends the text "commandlet"
/// onto the name and tries again.  Therefore, the following shortcuts
/// perform identically to the above:
///
///     UCC.exe Core.HelloWorld
///     UCC.exe Editor.Make
///     UCC.exe Make
///
/// It is also perfectly valid to call the Main method of a
/// commandlet class directly, for example from within the body
/// of another commandlet.
///
/// Commandlets are executed in a "raw" UnrealScript environment, in which
/// the game isn't loaded, the client code isn't loaded, no levels are
/// loaded, and no actors exist.
