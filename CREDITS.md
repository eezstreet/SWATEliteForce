# Credits

While I have been the driving force behind this mod, I owe a significant debt to the community who helped not only find a lot of these random issues, but also contributed a great deal of their time to finding more of them, and in a lot of cases, actively find the root cause of these issues.

I also owe a great deal of gratitude to the people who have helped crunch lots of numbers for me and helped to balance everything. I want to give an important shoutout to Jose21crisis, who was one of the first to do so, and tirelessly provided a lot of the early numbers until he was impacted by the crisis in Venezuela.

I also owe a lot of gratitude for TCR, Sandman332 and SeV for providing content, fixes and moderating the servers, and Kevin Foley for a huge amount of important items, as well as Brandon Alexander for providing music on the Extra Missions. And a huge thanks to Beppe_Goodoldrebel for finding a lot of bugfixes and providing models - his First Responders mod is great and worth checking out.

Also big thanks to SS for providing lots of server resources, including official servers.
